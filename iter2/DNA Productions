DNA Productions, Inc. was an American animation studio and production company founded in 1987 by John A. Davis and Keith Alcorn, which is best known for its comedy films. It also provided directing, script writing, and production to its clients.

History
DNA Productions was formed in Dallas by John A. Davis and Keith Alcorn in 1987, after they left their positions at K & H Productions (formerly Keitz & Herndon, Inc.), a locally based animation company. Up until 1997, DNA Productions had only six employees and was involved in the production of commercials. The company also did work for other companies.In 1999, the studio teamed up with The Curiosity Company and Fox Television Studios to make a holiday special for television entitled Olive, the Other Reindeer, which was nominated in the Emmy awards and also joined production with Steve Oedekerk's O Entertainment on the CG Christmas special, Santa vs. the Snowman 3D.
Starting in 1998, the studio pitched an idea of Jimmy Neutron to Nickelodeon in the form of a pilot episode called "Runaway Rocketboy", which led to the development and production of the feature film, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, which was later nominated for an Academy Award, and the television series The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius that was held in original airings from 2002 to 2006. In 2006, DNA Productions completed The Ant Bully, a feature film loosely based on the children's book of the same name, while production on The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius was ending. Due to The Ant Bully bombing at the box-office, DNA was unable to find another project afterwards, so the studio's facility closed later that year.

Mascots
Until 2002, the studio's mascot was formerly a purple cat with two tails in a DNA spiral formation named Helix the Cat; he was designed by Keith Alcorn. From 2002 to 2006, Helix the Cat was replaced by a computer-animated, three-eyed chimpanzee named Paul, named after and voiced by one of their employees Paul Claerhout.
