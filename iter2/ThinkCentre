All three desktops were equipped with Intel Pentium 4 processors. The chassis was made of steel and designed for easy component access without the use of tools. The hard disk was fixed in place by a 'caddy' without the use of screws. The caddy had rubber bumpers to reduce vibration and operational noise.Additional updates to the desktops included greater use of ThinkVantage technologies. All desktop models were made available with ImageUltra.
