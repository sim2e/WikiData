Molecular design software is notable software for molecular modeling, that provides special support for developing molecular models de novo.
In contrast to the usual molecular modeling programs, such as for molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry, such software directly supports the aspects related to constructing molecular models, including:

Molecular graphics
interactive molecular drawing and conformational editing
building polymeric molecules, crystals, and solvated systems
partial charges development
geometry optimization
support for the different aspects of force field development
