A regular language is said to be star-free if it can be described by a regular expression constructed from the letters of the alphabet, the empty set symbol, all boolean operators – including complementation – and concatenation but no Kleene star. The condition is equivalent to having generalized star height zero.
For instance, the language 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma ^{*}}
   of all finite words over an alphabet 
  
    
      
        Σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma }
   can be shown to be star-free by taking the complement of the empty set, 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              ∅
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma ^{*}={\bar {\emptyset }}}
  . Then, the language of words over the alphabet 
  
    
      
        {
        a
        ,
        
        b
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{a,\,b\}}
   that do not have consecutive a's can be defined as 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                Σ
                
                  ∗
                
              
              a
              a
              
                Σ
                
                  ∗
                
              
            
            ¯
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\overline {\Sigma ^{*}aa\Sigma ^{*}}}}
  , first constructing the language of words consisting of 
  
    
      
        a
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle aa}
   with an arbitrary prefix and suffix, and then taking its compliment, which must be all words which do not contain the substring 
  
    
      
        a
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle aa}
  .
An example of a regular language which is not star-free is 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        a
        
          )
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (aa)^{*}}
  , i.e. the language of strings consisting of an even number of "a". For 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        b
        
          )
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (ab)^{*}}
   where 
  
    
      
        a
        ≠
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\neq b}
  , the language can be defined as 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
        ∖
        (
        b
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
        ∪
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
        a
        ∪
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
        a
        a
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
        ∪
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
        b
        b
        
          Σ
          
            ∗
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma ^{*}\setminus (b\Sigma ^{*}\cup \Sigma ^{*}a\cup \Sigma ^{*}aa\Sigma ^{*}\cup \Sigma ^{*}bb\Sigma ^{*})}
  , taking the set of all words and removing from it words starting with 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  , ending in 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   or containing 
  
    
      
        a
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle aa}
   or 
  
    
      
        b
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle bb}
  . However, when 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=b}
  , this definition does not create  
  
    
      
        (
        a
        a
        
          )
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (aa)^{*}}
  .
Marcel-Paul Schützenberger characterized star-free languages as those with aperiodic syntactic monoids.  They can also be characterized logically as languages definable in FO[<], the first-order logic over the natural numbers with the less-than relation, as the counter-free languages and as languages definable in linear temporal logic.All star-free languages are in uniform AC0.
