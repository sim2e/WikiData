Toda's theorem is a result in computational complexity theory that was proven by Seinosuke Toda in his paper "PP is as Hard as the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy" and was given the 1998 Gödel Prize.

Statement
The theorem states that the entire polynomial hierarchy PH is contained in PPP; this implies a closely related statement, that PH is contained in P#P.

Definitions
#P is the problem of exactly counting the number of solutions to a polynomially-verifiable question (that is, to a question in NP), while loosely speaking, PP is the problem of giving an answer that is correct more than half the time. The class P#P consists of all the problems that can be solved in polynomial time if you have access to instantaneous answers to any counting problem in #P (polynomial time relative to a #P oracle). Thus Toda's theorem implies that for any problem in the polynomial hierarchy there is a deterministic polynomial-time Turing reduction to a counting problem.An analogous result in the complexity theory over the reals (in the sense of Blum–Shub–Smale real Turing machines) was proved by Saugata Basu and Thierry Zell in 2009 and a complex analogue of Toda's theorem was proved by Saugata Basu in 2011.

Proof
The proof is broken into two parts.

First, it is established that
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            P
          
        
        ⋅
        
          
            B
            P
          
        
        ⋅
        ⊕
        
          
            P
          
        
        ⊆
        
          
            B
            P
          
        
        ⋅
        ⊕
        
          
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma ^{P}\cdot {\mathsf {BP}}\cdot \oplus {\mathsf {P}}\subseteq {\mathsf {BP}}\cdot \oplus {\mathsf {P}}}
  The proof uses a variation of Valiant–Vazirani theorem. Because 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
            P
          
        
        ⋅
        ⊕
        
          
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {BP}}\cdot \oplus {\mathsf {P}}}
   contains 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {P}}}
   and is closed under complement, it follows by induction that 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
            H
          
        
        ⊆
        
          
            B
            P
          
        
        ⋅
        ⊕
        
          
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {PH}}\subseteq {\mathsf {BP}}\cdot \oplus {\mathsf {P}}}
  .Second, it is established that
  
    
      
        
          
            B
            P
          
        
        ⋅
        ⊕
        
          
            P
          
        
        ⊆
        
          
            
              P
            
          
          
            ♯
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {BP}}\cdot \oplus {\mathsf {P}}\subseteq {\mathsf {P}}^{\sharp P}}
  Together, the two parts imply

  
    
      
        
          
            P
            H
          
        
        ⊆
        
          
            B
            P
          
        
        ⋅
        ⊕
        
          
            P
          
        
        ⊆
        
          
            P
          
        
        ⋅
        ⊕
        
          
            P
          
        
        ⊆
        
          
            
              P
            
          
          
            ♯
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {PH}}\subseteq {\mathsf {BP}}\cdot \oplus {\mathsf {P}}\subseteq {\mathsf {P}}\cdot \oplus {\mathsf {P}}\subseteq {\mathsf {P}}^{\sharp P}}
