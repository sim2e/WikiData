Professional career
Wilkinson wrote SYSTAT, a statistical software package, in the early 1980s. This program was noted for its comprehensive graphics, including the first software implementation of the heatmap display now widely used among biologists. After his company grew to 50 employees, he sold it to SPSS in 1995. At SPSS, he assembled a team of graphics programmers who developed the nViZn platform  that produces the visualizations in SPSS, Clementine, and other analytics products. The nViZn platform was modeled after Wilkinson's 1999 book on statistical graphics, The Grammar of Graphics. This book also served as the foundation for the R package ggplot2, the Python Bokeh package, the R package ggbio, the Vega declarative language, and helped shape the Polaris project at Stanford University.Wilkinson served as the vice president of statistics at Tableau Software, where he continued to work on scientific visualization and statistical graphics. In 2016, he became a chief scientist at H2O.ai to lead a data visualization push; he remained in that role until his death.
