George V. Cybenko is the Dorothy and Walter Gramm Professor of
Engineering at Dartmouth and a fellow of the IEEE and SIAM.

Education
Cybenko obtained his BA in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1974 and received his PhD from Princeton in applied mathematics of electrical and computer engineering in 1978 under Bede Liu.

Work
Cybenko served as an advisor for the Defense Science Board and the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, among several other government panels. He was the founding editor-in-chief of Security & Privacy and also of Computing in Science & Engineering, both IEEE technical magazines.
His current research interests are distributed information, control systems, and signal processing, with a focus on applications to security and infrastructure protection.
He is known for proving the universal approximation theorem for artificial neural networks with sigmoid activation functions.

Awards
