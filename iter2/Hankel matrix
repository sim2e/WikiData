In linear algebra, a Hankel matrix (or catalecticant matrix), named after Hermann Hankel, is a square matrix in which each ascending skew-diagonal from left to right is constant, e.g.:

More generally, a Hankel matrix is any

        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\times n}
   matrix 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   of the form

In terms of the components, if the

   is denoted with 
  
    
      
        
          A

        i
        ≤
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\leq j}

Properties
Any Hankel matrix is symmetric.
Let 
  
    
      
        
          J
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle J_{n}}
   be the 
  
    
      
        n
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\times n}
   exchange matrix.  If 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
   is a 
  
    
      
        m
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\times n}
   Hankel matrix, then 
  
    
      
        H
        =
        T
        
          J
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H=TJ_{n}}
   where 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   is a 
  
    
      
        m
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\times n}
   Toeplitz matrix.
If 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   is real symmetric, then 
  
    
      
        H
        =
        T
        
          J
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H=TJ_{n}}
   will have the same eigenvalues as 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   up to sign.
The Hilbert matrix is an example of a Hankel matrix.

Relation to formal Laurent series
Hankel matrices are closely related to formal Laurent series. In fact, such a series 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        z
        )
        =
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            −
            ∞
          
          
            N
          
        
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
        
          z
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(z)=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{N}a_{n}z^{n}}
   gives rise to a linear map, referred to as a Hankel operator

Any Hankel matrix arises in such a way. A theorem due to Kronecker says that the rank of this matrix is finite precisely if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a rational function, i.e., a fraction of two polynomials

              q
              (
              z
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f={\frac {p(z)}{q(z)}}}
  .

Hankel operator
A Hankel operator on a Hilbert space is one whose matrix is a (possibly infinite) Hankel matrix with respect to an orthonormal basis. As indicated above, a Hankel Matrix is a matrix with constant values along its antidiagonals, which means that a Hankel matrix 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   must satisfy, for all rows 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   and columns 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  , 
  
    
      
        (
        
          A
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
        
          )
          
            i
            ,
            j
            ≥
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (A_{i,j})_{i,j\geq 1}}
  . Note that every entry 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{i,j}}
   depends only on 
  
    
      
        i
        +
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle i+j}
  .
Let the corresponding Hankel Operator be 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{\alpha }}
  . Given a Hankel matrix 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  , the corresponding Hankel operator is then defined as 
  
    
      
        
          H
          
            α
          
        
        (
        u
        )
        =
        A
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle H_{\alpha }(u)=Au}
  .

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\in \ell ^{2}(\mathbf {Z} )}
  , we have

We are often interested in approximations of the Hankel operators, possibly by low-order operators. In order to approximate the output of the operator, we can use the spectral norm (operator 2-norm) to measure the error of our approximation. This suggests singular value decomposition as a possible technique to approximate the action of the operator.
Note that the matrix 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   does not have to be finite. If it is infinite, traditional methods of computing individual singular vectors will not work directly. We also require that the approximation is a Hankel matrix, which can be shown with AAK theory.
The determinant of a Hankel matrix is called a catalecticant.

Hankel matrix transform
The Hankel matrix transform, or simply Hankel transform, produces the sequence of the determinants of the Hankel matrices formed from the given sequence.  Namely, the sequence 
  
    
      
        {
        
          h
          
            n
          
        
        
          }
          
            n
            ≥
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{h_{n}\}_{n\geq 0}}
   is the Hankel transform of the sequence 
  
    
      
        {
        
          b
          
            n
          
        
        
          }
          
            n
            ≥
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{b_{n}\}_{n\geq 0}}
   when

The Hankel transform is invariant under the binomial transform of a sequence.  That is, if one writes

as the binomial transform of the sequence 
  
    
      
        {
        
          b
          
            n
          
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{b_{n}\}}
  , then one has

Applications of Hankel matrices
Hankel matrices are formed when, given a sequence of output data, a realization of an underlying state-space or hidden Markov model is desired.  The singular value decomposition of the Hankel matrix provides a means of computing the A, B, and C matrices which define the state-space realization. The Hankel matrix formed from the signal has been found useful for decomposition of non-stationary signals and time-frequency representation.

Method of moments for polynomial distributions
The method of moments applied to polynomial distributions results in a Hankel matrix that needs to be inverted in order to obtain the weight parameters of the polynomial distribution approximation.
