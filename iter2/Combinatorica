Combinatorica is an international journal of mathematics, publishing papers in the fields of combinatorics and computer science. It started in 1981, with László Babai and László Lovász as the editors-in-chief with Paul Erdős as honorary editor-in-chief. The current editors-in-chief are Imre Bárány and József Solymosi. The advisory board consists of Ronald Graham, Gyula O. H. Katona, Miklós Simonovits, Vera Sós, and Endre Szemerédi. It is published by the János Bolyai Mathematical Society and Springer Verlag.
The following members of the Hungarian School of Combinatorics have strongly contributed to the journal as authors, or have served as editors: Miklós Ajtai, László Babai, József Beck, András Frank, Péter Frankl, Zoltán Füredi, András Hajnal, Gyula Katona, László Lovász, László Pyber, Alexander Schrijver, Miklós Simonovits, Vera Sós, Endre Szemerédi, Tamás Szőnyi, Éva Tardos, Gábor Tardos.
