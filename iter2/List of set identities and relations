This article lists mathematical properties and laws of sets, involving the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complementation and the relations of set equality and set inclusion. It also provides systematic procedures for evaluating expressions, and performing calculations, involving these operations and relations.
The binary operations of set union (
  
    
      
        ∪
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cup }
  ) and intersection (
  
    
      
        ∩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cap }
  ) satisfy many identities. Several of these identities or "laws" have well established names.

Throughout this article, capital letters (such as

   and 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  ) will denote sets. On the left hand side of an identity, typically,

  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   will be the L eft most set,

  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
   will be the M iddle set, and

  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   will be the R ight most set.This is to facilitate applying identities to expressions that are complicated or use the same symbols as the identity. 
For example, the identity 

may be read as:

where the symmetric difference 
  
    
      
        L
        △
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\triangle R}
   is sometimes denoted by 
  
    
      
        L
        ⊖
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\ominus R}
   and equals:
One set 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is said to intersect another set 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   if 
  
    
      
        L
        ∩
        R
        ≠
        ∅
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cap R\neq \varnothing .}
   Sets that do not intersect are said to be disjoint. 
The power set of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is the set of all subsets of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and will be denoted by

Universe set and complement notation
The notation 

may be used if 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is a subset of some set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   that is understood (say from context, or because it is clearly stated what the superset 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is). 
It is emphasized that the definition of 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∁
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{\complement }}
   depends on context. For instance, had 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   been declared as a subset of 
  
    
      
        Y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y,}
   with the sets 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   and 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   not necessarily related to each other in any way, then 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∁
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{\complement }}
   would likely mean 
  
    
      
        Y
        ∖
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y\setminus L}
   instead of 
  
    
      
        X
        ∖
        L
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\setminus L.}
  
If it is needed then unless indicated otherwise, it should be assumed that 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   denotes the universe set, which means that all sets that are used in the formula are subsets of 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
   
In particular, the complement of a set 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   will be denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∁
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{\complement }}
   where unless indicated otherwise, it should be assumed that 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∁
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{\complement }}
   denotes the complement of 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   in (the universe) 
  
    
      
        X
        .

Assume both

De Morgan's laws
De Morgan's laws state that for 
  
    
      
        L
        ,
        R
        ⊆
        X
        :
      
    
    {\displaystyle L,R\subseteq X:}

Commutativity
Unions, intersection, and symmetric difference are commutative operations:
Set subtraction is not commutative. However, the commutativity of set subtraction can be characterized: from 
  
    
      
        (
        L
        
        ∖
        
        R
        )
        ∩
        (
        R
        
        ∖
        
        L
        )
        =
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L\,\setminus \,R)\cap (R\,\setminus \,L)=\varnothing }
   it follows that:
 
Said differently, if distinct symbols always represented distinct sets, then the only true formulas of the form 
  
    
      
        
        ⋅
        
        
        ∖
        
        
        ⋅
        
        =
        
        ⋅
        
        
        ∖
        
        
        ⋅
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\cdot \,\,\setminus \,\,\cdot \,=\,\cdot \,\,\setminus \,\,\cdot \,}
   that could be written would be those involving a single symbol; that is, those of the form: 
  
    
      
        S
        
        ∖
        
        S
        =
        S
        
        ∖
        
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\,\setminus \,S=S\,\setminus \,S.}
   
But such formulas are necessarily true for every binary operation 
  
    
      
        
        ∗
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\ast \,}
   (because 
  
    
      
        x
        
        ∗
        
        x
        =
        x
        
        ∗
        
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\,\ast \,x=x\,\ast \,x}
   must hold by definition of equality), and so in this sense, set subtraction is as diametrically opposite to being commutative as is possible for a binary operation. 
Set subtraction is also neither left alternative nor right alternative; instead, 
  
    
      
        (
        L
        ∖
        L
        )
        ∖
        R
        =
        L
        ∖
        (
        L
        ∖
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L\setminus L)\setminus R=L\setminus (L\setminus R)}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        L
        ∩
        R
        =
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cap R=\varnothing }
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        (
        R
        ∖
        L
        )
        ∖
        L
        =
        R
        ∖
        (
        L
        ∖
        L
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle (R\setminus L)\setminus L=R\setminus (L\setminus L).}
   
Set subtraction is quasi-commutative and satisfies the Jordan identity.

Empty set
A set 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is empty if the sentence 
  
    
      
        ∀
        x
        (
        x
        ∉
        L
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall x(x\not \in L)}
   is true, where the notation 
  
    
      
        x
        ∉
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\not \in L}
   is shorthand for 
  
    
      
        ¬
        (
        x
        ∈
        L
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lnot (x\in L).}
   
If 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is any set then the following are equivalent:

  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is not empty, meaning that the sentence 
  
    
      
        ¬
        [
        ∀
        x
        (
        x
        ∉
        L
        )
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lnot [\forall x(x\not \in L)]}
   is true (literally, the logical negation of "
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is empty" holds true).
(In classical mathematics) 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is inhabited, meaning: 
  
    
      
        ∃
        x
        (
        x
        ∈
        L
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \exists x(x\in L)}
  
In constructive mathematics, "not empty" and "inhabited" are not equivalent: every inhabited set is not empty but the converse is not always guaranteed; that is, in constructive mathematics, a set 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   that is not empty (where by definition, "
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is empty" means that the statement 
  
    
      
        ∀
        x
        (
        x
        ∉
        L
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall x(x\not \in L)}
   is true) might not have an inhabitant (which is an 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}

        ∀
        x
        (
        x
        ∉

Meets, Joins, and lattice properties
Inclusion is a partial order: 
Explicitly, this means that inclusion 
  
    
      
        
        ⊆
        ,
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\subseteq ,\,}
   which is a binary operation, has the following three properties:
Reflexivity: 

  
    
      
        L
        ⊆
        L
      
    
    {\textstyle L\subseteq L}
  
Antisymmetry: 

  
    
      
        (

        R
        
           and 
        
        R
        ⊆
        L
        )
        
           if and only if

        R
      
    
    {\textstyle (L\subseteq R{\text{ and }}R\subseteq L){\text{ if and only if }}L=R}
  
Transitivity: 

  
    
      
        
          If 
        
        L
        ⊆

        M
        ⊆
        R
        
           then 
        
        L

        R
      
    
    {\textstyle {\text{If }}L\subseteq M{\text{ and }}M\subseteq R{\text{ then }}L\subseteq R}
  
The following proposition says that for any set 
  
    
      
        S
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle S,}
   the power set of 
  
    
      
        S
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle S,}
   ordered by inclusion, is a bounded lattice, and hence together with the distributive and complement laws above, show that it is a Boolean algebra.

Precedence rules
There is no universal agreement on the order of precedence of the basic set operators.
Nevertheless, many authors use precedence rules for set operators, although these rules vary with the author. 
One common convention is to associate intersection 
  
    
      
        L
        ∩
        R
        =
        {

        :
        (
        x
        ∈
        L
        )
        ∧
        (
        x
        ∈

   and associate union 
  
    
      
        L
        ∪
        R
        =
        {
        x
        :
        (
        x
        ∈
        L
        )
        ∨
        (
        x
        ∈
        R
        )
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cup R=\{x:(x\in L)\lor (x\in R)\}}
   with logical disjunction (or) 
  
    
      
        L
        ∨
        R
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\lor R,}
   and then transfer the precedence of these logical operators (where 
  
    
      
        
        ∧
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\land \,}
   has precedence over 
  
    
      
        
        ∨
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\lor \,}
  ) to these set operators, thereby giving 
  
    
      
        
        ∩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\cap \,}
   precedence over 
  
    
      
        
        ∪
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\cup .\,}
   
So for example, 
  
    
      
        L
        ∪
        M
        ∩
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cup M\cap R}
   would mean 
  
    
      
        L
        ∪
        (
        M
        ∩
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cup (M\cap R)}
   since it would be associated with the logical statement 
  
    
      
        L
        ∨
        M
        ∧
        R
         
        =
         
        L
        ∨
        (
        M
        ∧
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\lor M\land R~=~L\lor (M\land R)}
   and similarly, 
  
    
      
        L
        ∪
        M
        ∩
        R
        ∪
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cup M\cap R\cup Z}
   would mean 
  
    
      
        L
        ∪
        (
        M
        ∩
        R
        )
        ∪
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cup (M\cap R)\cup Z}
   since it would be associated with 
  
    
      
        L
        ∨
        M
        ∧
        R
        ∨
        Z
         
        =
         
        L
        ∨
        (
        M
        ∧
        R
        )
        ∨
        Z
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\lor M\land R\lor Z~=~L\lor (M\land R)\lor Z.}
   
Sometimes, set complement (subtraction) 
  
    
      
        
        ∖
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\setminus \,}
   is also associated with logical complement (not) 
  
    
      
        
        ¬
        ,
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\lnot ,\,}
   in which case it will have the highest precedence. 
More specifically, 
  
    
      
        L
        ∖
        R
        =
        {
        x
        :
        (
        x
        ∈
        L
        )
        ∧
        ¬
        (
        x
        ∈
        R
        )
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\setminus R=\{x:(x\in L)\land \lnot (x\in R)\}}
   is rewritten 
  
    
      
        L
        ∧
        ¬
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\land \lnot R}
   so that for example, 
  
    
      
        L
        ∪
        M
        ∖
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cup M\setminus R}
   would mean 
  
    
      
        L
        ∪
        (
        M
        ∖
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cup (M\setminus R)}
   since it would be rewritten as the logical statement 
  
    
      
        L
        ∨
        M
        ∧
        ¬
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\lor M\land \lnot R}
   which is equal to 
  
    
      
        L
        ∨
        (
        M
        ∧
        ¬
        R
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\lor (M\land \lnot R).}
  
For another example, because 
  
    
      
        L
        ∧
        ¬
        M
        ∧
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\land \lnot M\land R}
   means 
  
    
      
        L
        ∧
        (
        ¬
        M
        )
        ∧
        R
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\land (\lnot M)\land R,}
   which is equal to both 
  
    
      
        (
        L
        ∧
        (
        ¬
        M
        )
        )
        ∧
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L\land (\lnot M))\land R}
   and 
  
    
      
        L
        ∧
        (
        (
        ¬
        M
        )
        ∧
        R
        )
         
        =
         
        L
        ∧
        (
        R
        ∧
        (
        ¬
        M
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\land ((\lnot M)\land R)~=~L\land (R\land (\lnot M))}
   (where 
  
    
      
        (
        ¬
        M
        )
        ∧
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\lnot M)\land R}
   was rewritten as 
  
    
      
        R
        ∧
        (
        ¬
        M
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R\land (\lnot M)}
  ), the formula 
  
    
      
        L
        ∖
        M
        ∩
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\setminus M\cap R}
   would refer to the set 
  
    
      
        (
        L
        ∖
        M
        )
        ∩
        R
        =
        L
        ∩
        (
        R
        ∖
        M
        )
        ;
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L\setminus M)\cap R=L\cap (R\setminus M);}
   
moreover, since 
  
    
      
        L
        ∧
        (
        ¬
        M
        )
        ∧
        R
        =
        (
        L
        ∧
        R
        )
        ∧
        ¬
        M
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\land (\lnot M)\land R=(L\land R)\land \lnot M,}
   this set is also equal to 
  
    
      
        (
        L
        ∩
        R
        )
        ∖
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L\cap R)\setminus M}
   (other set identities can similarly be deduced from propositional calculus identities in this way).
However, because set subtraction is not associative 
  
    
      
        (
        L
        ∖
        M
        )
        ∖
        R
        ≠
        L
        ∖
        (
        M
        ∖
        R
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L\setminus M)\setminus R\neq L\setminus (M\setminus R),}
   a formula such as 
  
    
      
        L
        ∖
        M
        ∖
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\setminus M\setminus R}
   would be ambiguous; for this reason, among others, set subtraction is often not assigned any precedence at all. 
Symmetric difference 
  
    
      
        L
        △
        R
        =
        {
        x
        :
        (
        x
        ∈
        L
        )
        ⊕
        (
        x
        ∈
        R
        )
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\triangle R=\{x:(x\in L)\oplus (x\in R)\}}
   is sometimes associated with exclusive or (xor) 
  
    
      
        L
        ⊕
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\oplus R}
   (also sometimes denoted by 
  
    
      
        
        ⊻
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\veebar }
  ), in which case if the order of precedence from highest to lowest is 
  
    
      
        
        ¬
        ,
        
        ⊕
        ,
        
        ∧
        ,
        
        ∨
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\lnot ,\,\oplus ,\,\land ,\,\lor \,}
   then the order of precedence (from highest to lowest) for the set operators would be 
  
    
      
        
        ∖
        ,
        
        △
        ,
        
        ∩
        ,
        
        ∪
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\setminus ,\,\triangle ,\,\cap ,\,\cup .}
   
There is no universal agreement on the precedence of exclusive disjunction 
  
    
      
        
        ⊕
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\oplus \,}
   with respect to the other logical connectives, which is why symmetric difference 
  
    
      
        
        △
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\triangle \,}
   is not often assigned a precedence.

Associativity
Definition: A binary operator 
  
    
      
        
        ∗
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\ast \,}
   is called associative if 
  
    
      
        (
        L
        
        ∗
        
        M
        )
        
        ∗
        
        R
        =
        L
        
        ∗
        
        (
        M
        
        ∗
        
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L\,\ast \,M)\,\ast \,R=L\,\ast \,(M\,\ast \,R)}
   always holds. 
The following set operators are associative:
For set subtraction, instead of associativity, only the following is always guaranteed:

where equality holds if and only if 
  
    
      
        L
        ∩
        R
        =
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cap R=\varnothing }
   (this condition does not depend on 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
  ). Thus 

  
    
      
        
        (
        L
        ∖
        M
        )
        ∖
        R
        =
        L
        ∖
        (
        M
        ∖
        R
        )
        
      
    
    {\textstyle \;(L\setminus M)\setminus R=L\setminus (M\setminus R)\;}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        
        (
        R
        ∖
        M
        )
        ∖
        L
        =
        R
        ∖
        (
        M
        ∖
        L
        )
        ,
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;(R\setminus M)\setminus L=R\setminus (M\setminus L),\;}
   
where the only difference between the left and right hand side set equalities is that the locations of 
  
    
      
        L
        
           and 
        
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L{\text{ and }}R}
   have been swapped.

Distributivity
Definition: If 
  
    
      
        ∗
        
           and 
        
        ∙
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ast {\text{ and }}\bullet }
   are binary operators then 
  
    
      
        
        ∗
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\ast \,}
   left distributes over 
  
    
      
        
        ∙
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\bullet \,}
   if 
while 
  
    
      
        
        ∗
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\ast \,}
   right distributes over 
  
    
      
        
        ∙
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\bullet \,}
   if  
The operator 
  
    
      
        
        ∗
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\ast \,}
   distributes over 
  
    
      
        
        ∙
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\bullet \,}
   if it both left distributes and right distributes over 
  
    
      
        
        ∙
        
        .
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\bullet \,.\,}
   
In the definitions above, to transform one side to the other, the innermost operator (the operator inside the parentheses) becomes the outermost operator and the outermost operator becomes the innermost operator.
Right distributivity:
Left distributivity:

Distributivity and symmetric difference ∆
Intersection distributes over symmetric difference:

Union does not distribute over symmetric difference because only the following is guaranteed in general:

Symmetric difference does not distribute over itself:

and in general, for any sets 
  
    
      
        L
        
           and 
        
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle L{\text{ and }}A}
   (where 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   represents 
  
    
      
        M
        
        △
        
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle M\,\triangle \,R}
  ), 
  
    
      
        L
        
        △
        
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\,\triangle \,A}
   might not be a subset, nor a superset, of 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   (and the same is true for 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  ).

Distributivity and set subtraction \
Failure of set subtraction to left distribute:
Set subtraction is right distributive over itself. However, set subtraction is not left distributive over itself because only the following is guaranteed in general:

where equality holds if and only if 
  
    
      
        L
        
        ∖
        
        M
        =
        L
        
        ∩
        
        R
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\,\setminus \,M=L\,\cap \,R,}
   which happens if and only if 
  
    
      
        L
        ∩
        M
        ∩
        R
        =
        ∅
        
           and 
        
        L
        ∖
        M
        ⊆
        R
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cap M\cap R=\varnothing {\text{ and }}L\setminus M\subseteq R.}
   
For symmetric difference, the sets 
  
    
      
        L
        
        ∖
        
        (
        M
        
        △
        
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\,\setminus \,(M\,\triangle \,R)}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        L
        
        ∖
        
        M
        )
        
        △
        
        (
        L
        
        ∖
        
        R
        )
        =
        L
        
        ∩
        
        (
        M
        
        △
        
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L\,\setminus \,M)\,\triangle \,(L\,\setminus \,R)=L\,\cap \,(M\,\triangle \,R)}
   are always disjoint. 
So these two sets are equal if and only if they are both equal to 
  
    
      
        ∅
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varnothing .}
   
Moreover, 
  
    
      
        L
        
        ∖
        
        (
        M
        
        △
        
        R
        )
        =
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\,\setminus \,(M\,\triangle \,R)=\varnothing }
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        L
        ∩
        M
        ∩
        R
        =
        ∅
        
           and 
        
        L
        ⊆
        M
        ∪
        R
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cap M\cap R=\varnothing {\text{ and }}L\subseteq M\cup R.}
   
To investigate the left distributivity of set subtraction over unions or intersections, consider how the sets involved in (both of) De Morgan's laws are all related:

always holds (the equalities on the left and right are De Morgan's laws) but equality is not guaranteed in general (that is, the containment 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              ⊆
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\color {red}{\subseteq }}}
   might be strict). 
Equality holds if and only if 
  
    
      
        L
        
        ∖
        
        (
        M
        
        ∩
        
        R
        )
        
        ⊆
        
        L
        
        ∖
        
        (
        M
        
        ∪
        
        R
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\,\setminus \,(M\,\cap \,R)\;\subseteq \;L\,\setminus \,(M\,\cup \,R),}
   which happens if and only if 
  
    
      
        L
        
        ∩
        
        M
        =
        L
        
        ∩
        
        R
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\,\cap \,M=L\,\cap \,R.}
   
This observation about De Morgan's laws shows that 
  
    
      
        
        ∖
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\setminus \,}
   is not left distributive over 
  
    
      
        
        ∪
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\cup \,}
   or 
  
    
      
        
        ∩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\cap \,}
   because only the following are guaranteed in general:

where equality holds for one (or equivalently, for both) of the above two inclusion formulas if and only if 
  
    
      
        L
        
        ∩
        
        M
        =
        L
        
        ∩
        
        R
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\,\cap \,M=L\,\cap \,R.}
   
The following statements are equivalent:

  
    
      
        L
        ∩
        M
        
        =
        
        L
        ∩
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cap M\,=\,L\cap R}
  

  
    
      
        L

        =

Set subtraction complexity: To manage the many identities involving set subtraction, this section is divided based on where the set subtraction operation and parentheses are located on the left hand side of the identity. The great variety and (relative) complexity of formulas involving set subtraction (compared to those without it) is in part due to the fact that unlike

since only the following is always guaranteed:

Definitions
A family of sets or (more briefly) a family refers to a set whose elements are sets. 
An indexed family of sets is a function from some set, called its indexing set, into some family of sets. 
An indexed family of sets will be denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              L
              
                i
              
            
            )
          
          
            i
            ∈
            I
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(L_{i}\right)_{i\in I},}
   where this notation assigns the symbol 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
   for the indexing set and for every index 
  
    
      
        i
        ∈
        I
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\in I,}
   assigns the symbol 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{i}}
   to the value of the function at 
  
    
      
        i
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle i.}
   
The function itself may then be denoted by the symbol 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ∙
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{\bullet },}
   which is obtained from the notation 
  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              L
              
                i
              
            
            )
          
          
            i

Conversely, any given family of sets

  -indexed family of sets

However, this is not a bijective correspondence because an indexed family of sets

    {\displaystyle L_{\bullet }=\left(L_{i}\right)_{i\in I}}
   is not required to be injective (that is, there may exist distinct indices 
  
    
      
        i
        ≠
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\neq j}
   such as 
  
    
      
        
          L

            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{i}=L_{j}}
  ), which in particular means that it is possible for distinct indexed families of sets (which are functions) to be associated with the same family of sets (by having the same image/range).

   a proper class and not a set.Assumption: Henceforth, whenever a formula requires some indexing set to be non-empty in order for an arbitrary intersection to be well-defined, then this will automatically be assumed without mention.A consequence of this is the following assumption/definition:

A finite intersection of sets or an intersection of finitely many sets refers to the intersection of a finite collection of one or more sets.Some authors adopt the so called nullary intersection convention, which is the convention that an empty intersection of sets is equal to some canonical set. In particular, if all sets are subsets of some set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   then some author may declare that the empty intersection of these sets be equal to 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
   However, the nullary intersection convention is not as commonly accepted as the nullary union convention and this article will not adopt it (this is due to the fact that unlike the empty union, the value of the empty intersection depends on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   so if there are multiple sets under consideration, which is commonly the case, then the value of the empty intersection risks becoming ambiguous).

   this is technically just a change of notation). Recall that Eq. 5 ∩∪ to ∪∩ was  
  
Expanding and simplifying the left hand side gives

and doing the same to the right hand side gives:

Thus the general identity Eq. 5 ∩∪ to ∪∩ reduces down to the previously given set equality Eq. 3b:

Distributing subtraction over ⋃ and ⋂
The next identities are known as De Morgan's laws.
The following four set equalities can be deduced from the equalities 7a - 7d above. 

In general, naively swapping 
  
    
      
        
        ∪
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\cup \;}
   and 
  
    
      
        
        ∩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\cap \;}
   may produce a different set (see this note for more details). 
The equalities 
 
found in Eq. 7e and Eq. 7f are thus unusual in that they state exactly that swapping 
  
    
      
        
        ∪
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\cup \;}
   and 
  
    
      
        
        ∩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\cap \;}
   will not change the resulting set.

However, sometimes these products are somehow identified as the same set through some bijection or one of these products is identified as a subset of the other via some injective map, in which case (by abuse of notation) this intersection may be equal to some other (possibly non-empty) set.

Functions and sets
Let 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   be any function. 
Let 
  
    
      
        L
        
           and 
        
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L{\text{ and }}R}
   be completely arbitrary sets. Assume 
  
    
      
        A
        ⊆
        X
        
           and

Definitions
Let 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   be any function, where we denote its domain 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   by 
  
    
      
        domain
        ⁡
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {domain} f}
   and denote its codomain 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   by 
  
    
      
        codomain
        ⁡
        f
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {codomain} f.}
   
Many of the identities below do not actually require that the sets be somehow related to 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  's domain or codomain (that is, to 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   or 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  ) so when some kind of relationship is necessary then it will be clearly indicated. 
Because of this, in this article, if 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is declared to be "any set," and it is not indicated that 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   must be somehow related to 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   or 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   (say for instance, that it be a subset 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   or 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  ) then it is meant that 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is truly arbitrary. 
This generality is useful in situations where 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   is a map between two subsets 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊆
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\subseteq U}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
        ⊆
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y\subseteq V}
   of some larger sets 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}

        V
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle V,}
   and where the set 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   might not be entirely contained in

        ⁡
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y=\operatorname {codomain} f}
   (e.g. if all that is known about 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is that

        ⊆
        U

   without having to introduce a (potentially unnecessary) intersection such as: 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        L
        ∩

Summary
As the table below shows, set equality is not guaranteed only for images of: intersections, set subtractions, and symmetric differences. 

Preimages preserve set operations
Preimages of sets are well-behaved with respect to all basic set operations:

In words, preimages distribute over unions, intersections, set subtraction, and symmetric difference. 
Images only preserve unions
Images of unions are well-behaved:

but images of the other basic set operations are not since only the following are guaranteed in general:

In words, images distribute over unions but not necessarily over intersections, set subtraction, or symmetric difference. 
In general, equality is not guaranteed for images of set subtraction

   nor for images of the other two elementary set operators that can be defined as the difference of two sets:

Counter-examples: images of operations not distributing
If 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        {
        1
        ,
        2
        }
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:\{1,2\}\to Y}
   is constant,

   and

        {
        2
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle R=\{2\}}
   then all four of the set containments

are strict/proper (that is, the sets are not equal) since one side is the empty set while the other is non-empty. Thus equality is not guaranteed for even the simplest of functions. 
The example above is now generalized to show that these four set equalities can fail for any constant function whose domain contains at least two (distinct) points. 
Example: Let 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   be any constant function with image 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        X
        )
        =
        {
        y
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(X)=\{y\}}
   and suppose that 
  
    
      
        L
        ,
        R
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle L,R\subseteq X}
   are non-empty disjoint subsets; that is, 
  
    
      
        L
        ≠
        ∅
        ,
        R
        ≠
        ∅
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\neq \varnothing ,R\neq \varnothing ,}
   and 
  
    
      
        L
        ∩
        R
        =
        ∅
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\cap R=\varnothing ,}
   which implies that all of the sets 
  
    
      
        L
         
        △

    {\displaystyle X\setminus R\supseteq L\setminus R}
   are not empty and so consequently, their images under 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   are all equal to

What the set operations in these four examples have in common is that they either are set subtraction 
  
    
      
        ∖
      
    
    {\displaystyle \setminus }
   (examples (1) and (2)) or else they can naturally be defined as the set subtraction of two sets (examples (3) and (4)).
Mnemonic: In fact, for each of the above four set formulas for which equality is not guaranteed, the direction of the containment (that is, whether to use 
  
    
      
        
        ⊆
        
           or 
        
        ⊇
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\subseteq {\text{ or }}\supseteq \,}
  ) can always be deduced by imagining the function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   as being constant and the two sets (
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   and 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  ) as being non-empty disjoint subsets of its domain. This is because every equality fails for such a function and sets: one side will be always be 
  
    
      
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varnothing }
   and the other non-empty − from this fact, the correct choice of 
  
    
      
        
        ⊆
        
           or 
        
        ⊇
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\subseteq {\text{ or }}\supseteq \,}
   can be deduced by answering: "which side is empty?" For example, to decide if the 
  
    
      
        ?
      
    
    {\displaystyle ?}
   in 

should be 
  
    
      
        
        ⊆
        
           or 
        
        ⊇
        ,
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\subseteq {\text{ or }}\supseteq ,\,}
   pretend 
that 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is constant and that 
  
    
      
        L
        △
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle L\triangle R}
   and 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   are non-empty disjoint subsets of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
  's domain; then the left hand side would be empty (since 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        L
        △
        R
        )
        ∖
        f
        (
        R
        )
        =
        {
        f
        
          's single value
        
        }
        ∖
        {
        f
        
          's single value
        
        }
        =
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(L\triangle R)\setminus f(R)=\{f{\text{'s single value}}\}\setminus \{f{\text{'s single value}}\}=\varnothing }
  ), which indicates that 
  
    
      
        
        ?
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,?\,}
   should be 
  
    
      
        
        ⊆
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\subseteq \,}
   (the resulting statement is always guaranteed to be true) because this is the choice that will make

true. 
Alternatively, the correct direction of containment can also be deduced by consideration of any constant 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        {
        1
        ,
        2
        }
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:\{1,2\}\to Y}
   with 
  
    
      
        L
        =
        {
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle L=\{1\}}
   and 
  
    
      
        R
        =
        {
        2
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle R=\{2\}.}
   
Furthermore, this mnemonic can also be used to correctly deduce whether or not a set operation always distribute over images or preimages; for example, to determine whether or not 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        L
        ∩
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(L\cap R)}
   always equals 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        L
        )
        ∩
        f
        (
        R
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(L)\cap f(R),}
   or alternatively, whether or not 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        L
        ∩
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}(L\cap R)}
   always equals 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        L
        )
        ∩
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        R
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}(L)\cap f^{-1}(R)}
   (although 
  
    
      
        
        ∩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\cap \,}
   was used here, it can replaced by 
  
    
      
        
        ∪
        ,
        
        ∖
        ,
        
           or 
        
        
        △
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\cup ,\,\setminus ,{\text{ or }}\,\triangle }
  ). The answer to such a question can, as before, be deduced by consideration of this constant function: the answer for the general case (that is, for arbitrary 
  
    
      
        f
        ,
        L
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f,L,}
   and 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  ) is always the same as the answer for this choice of (constant) function and disjoint non-empty sets.

Conditions guaranteeing that images distribute over set operations
Characterizations of when equality holds for all sets:
For any function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y,}
   the following statements are equivalent:

  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   is injective. 
This means: 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )

Any one of the four statements (b) - (e) but with the words "for all" replaced with any one of the following:
"for all singleton subsets"
In particular, the statement that results from (d) gives a characterization of injectivity that explicitly involves only one point (rather than two): 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is injective if and only if 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        ∉
        f
        (
        X
        ∖
        {
        x
        }
        )
        
        
           for every 
        
        
        x
        ∈
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)\not \in f(X\setminus \{x\})\;{\text{ for every }}\,x\in X.}
  "for all disjoint singleton subsets"
For statement (d), this is the same as: "for all singleton subsets" (because the definition of "pairwise disjoint" is satisfies vacuously by any family that consists of exactly 1 set)."for all disjoint subsets"

In particular, if a map is not known to be injective then barring additional information, there is no guarantee that any of the equalities in statements (b) - (e) hold.
An example above can be used to help prove this characterization. Indeed, comparison of that example with such a proof suggests that the example is representative of the fundamental reason why one of these four equalities in statements (b) - (e) might not hold (that is, representative of "what goes wrong" when a set equality does not hold).
