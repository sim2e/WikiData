The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to life forms:
A life form (also spelled life-form or lifeform) is an entity that is living, such as plants (flora), animals (fauna), and fungi (funga). It is estimated that more than 99% of all species that ever existed on Earth, amounting to over five billion species, are extinct.Earth is the only celestial body known to harbor life forms. No form of extraterrestrial life has been discovered yet.

Archaea
Archaea – a domain of single-celled microorganisms, morphologically similar to bacteria, but they possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are more closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Many archaea are extremophiles, which means living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, but they have since been found in a broad range of habitats.
Thermoproteota – a phylum of the Archaea kingdom. Initially
Thermoprotei
Sulfolobales – grow in terrestrial volcanic hot springs with optimum growth occurring
Euryarchaeota – In the taxonomy of microorganisms
Haloarchaea
Halobacteriales – in taxonomy, the Halobacteriales are an order of the Halobacteria, found in water saturated or nearly saturated with    salt.
Methanobacteria
Methanobacteriales – information including symptoms, causes, diseases, symptoms, treatments, and other medical and health issues.
Methanococci
Methanococcales aka Methanocaldococcus jannaschii – thermophilic methanogenic archaea, meaning that it thrives at high temperatures and produces methane
Methanomicrobia
Methanosarcinales – In taxonomy, the Methanosarcinales are an order of the Methanomicrobia
Methanopyri
Methanopyrales – In taxonomy, the Methanopyrales are an order of the methanopyri.
Thermococci
Thermococcales
Thermoplasmata
Thermoplasmatales –  An order of aerobic, thermophilic archaea, in the kingdom
Halophiles – organisms that thrive in high salt concentrations
Korarchaeota
Korarchaeum cryptofilum – These archaea have only been found in high temperature hydrothermal environments, particularly hot springs
Lokiarchaeota
Methanogens
Nanoarchaeota
Nanoarchaeum equitans – This organism was discovered in 2002 and lives inside another archaea.
Psychrophiles – (sigh-crow-files)
Nitrososphaerota –  a phylum of the Archaea proposed in 2008 after the genome of Cenarchaeum symbiosum
thermophilic – (a thermophile is an organism)

Animal – multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.
