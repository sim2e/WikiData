A robotics suite is a visual environment for robot control and simulation. They are typically an end-to-end platform for robotics development and include tools for visual programming and creating and debugging robot applications. Developers can often interact with robots through web-based or visual interfaces.
One objective of a robotics suite is to support a variety of different robot platforms through a common programming interface. The key point about a robotics suite is that the same code will run either with a simulated robot or the corresponding real robot without modification.
Some robotic suites are based in free software, free hardware and both free software and hardware.
