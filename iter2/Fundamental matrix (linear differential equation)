In mathematics, a fundamental matrix of a system of n homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations

is a matrix-valued function 
  
    
      
        Ψ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Psi (t)}
   whose columns are linearly independent solutions of the system.
Then every solution to the system can be written as 
  
    
      
        
          x
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        Ψ
        (
        t
        )
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} (t)=\Psi (t)\mathbf {c} }
  , for some constant vector 
  
    
      
        
          c
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {c} }
   (written as a column vector of height n).
One can show that a matrix-valued function 
  
    
      
        Ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Psi }
   is a fundamental matrix of  
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                x
              
              ˙
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        A
        (
        t
        )
        
          x
        
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\dot {\mathbf {x} }}(t)=A(t)\mathbf {x} (t)}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              Ψ
              ˙
            
          
        
        (
        t
        )
        =
        A
        (
        t
        )
        Ψ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\dot {\Psi }}(t)=A(t)\Psi (t)}
   and 
  
    
      
        Ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Psi }
   is a non-singular matrix for all 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  .

Control theory
The fundamental matrix is used to express the state-transition matrix, an essential component in the solution of a system of linear ordinary differential equations.
