In mathematics, especially linear algebra, the exchange matrices (also called the reversal matrix, backward identity, or standard involutory permutation) are special cases of permutation matrices, where the 1 elements reside on the antidiagonal and all other elements are zero. In other words, they are 'row-reversed' or 'column-reversed' versions of the identity matrix.

  Exchange matrices are symmetric; that is, JnT = Jn.
For any integer k, Jnk = I if k is even and Jnk = Jn if k is odd. In particular, Jn is an involutory matrix; that is, Jn−1 = Jn.
The trace of Jn is 1 if n is odd and 0 if n is even. In other words, the trace of Jn equals 
  
    
      
        n
        
          mod
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n{\bmod {2}}}
  .
The determinant of Jn equals 
  
    
      
        (
        −
        1
        
          )
          
            n
            (
            n
            −
            1
            )
            
              /
            
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}}
  . As a function of n, it has period 4, giving 1, 1, −1, −1 when n is congruent modulo 4 to 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
The characteristic polynomial of Jn is

              /

    {\displaystyle \det(\lambda I-J_{n})={\big (}(\lambda +1)(\lambda -1){\big )}^{n/2}}
   when n is even, and 
  
    
      
        (
        λ
        −
        1

            −
            1
            )
            
              /
            
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\lambda -1)^{(n+1)/2}(\lambda +1)^{(n-1)/2}}
   when n is odd.
The adjugate matrix of Jn is 
  
    
      
        adj
        ⁡

Relationships
An exchange matrix is the simplest anti-diagonal matrix.
Any matrix A satisfying the condition AJ = JA is said to be centrosymmetric.
Any matrix A satisfying the condition AJ = JAT is said to be persymmetric.
Symmetric matrices A that satisfy the condition AJ = JA are called bisymmetric matrices. Bisymmetric matrices are both centrosymmetric and persymmetric.
