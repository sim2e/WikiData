In computational complexity theory, the Sipser–Lautemann theorem or Sipser–Gács–Lautemann theorem states that bounded-error probabilistic polynomial (BPP) time is contained in the polynomial time hierarchy, and more specifically Σ2 ∩ Π2.
In 1983, Michael Sipser showed that BPP is contained in the polynomial time hierarchy. Péter Gács showed that BPP is actually contained in Σ2 ∩ Π2. Clemens Lautemann contributed by giving a simple proof of BPP’s membership in Σ2 ∩ Π2, also in 1983. It is conjectured that in fact BPP=P, which is a much stronger statement than the Sipser–Lautemann theorem.

Proof
Here we present the Lautemann's proof. Without loss of generality, a machine M ∈ BPP with error ≤ 2−|x| can be chosen.  (All BPP problems can be amplified to reduce the error probability exponentially.)  The basic idea of the proof is to define a Σ2 sentence that is equivalent to stating that x is in the language, L, defined by M by using a set of transforms of the random variable inputs.
Since the output of M depends on random input, as well as the input x, it is useful to define which random strings produce the correct output as A(x) = {r | M(x,r) accepts}.  The key to the proof is to note that when x ∈ L, A(x) is very large and when x ∉ L, A(x) is very small.  By using bitwise parity, ⊕, a set of transforms can be defined as A(x) ⊕ t={r ⊕ t | r ∈ A(x)}.  The first main lemma of the proof shows that the union of a small finite number of these transforms will contain the entire space of random input strings.  Using this fact, a Σ2 sentence and a Π2 sentence can be generated that is true if and only if x ∈ L (see conclusion).

Lemma 1
The general idea of lemma one is to prove that if A(x) covers a large part of the random space 
  
    
      
        R
        =
        {
        1
        ,
        0
        
          }
          
            
              |
            
            r
            
              |
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R=\{1,0\}^{|r|}}
   then there exists a small set of translations that will cover the entire random space.  In more mathematical language:

Conclusion
The lemmas show that language membership of a language in BPP can be expressed as a Σ2 expression, as follows.

  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        L
        
        ⟺
        
        ∃
        
          t
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          t
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          t
          
            
              |
            
            r
            
              |
            
          
        
        
        ∀
        r
        ∈
        R
        
          ⋁
          
            1
            ≤
            i
            ≤
            
              |
            
            r
            
              |
            
          
        
        (
        M
        (
        x
        ,
        r
        ⊕
        
          t
          
            i
          
        
        )
        
           accepts
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in L\iff \exists t_{1},t_{2},\dots ,t_{|r|}\,\forall r\in R\bigvee _{1\leq i\leq |r|}(M(x,r\oplus t_{i}){\text{ accepts}}).}
  That is, x is in language L if and only if there exist 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        r
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |r|}
   binary vectors, where for all random bit vectors r, TM M accepts at least one random vector ⊕ ti.
The above expression is in Σ2 in that it is first existentially then universally quantified.  Therefore BPP ⊆ Σ2.  Because BPP is closed under complement, this proves BPP ⊆ Σ2 ∩ Π2.

Stronger version
The theorem can be strengthened to

          Π
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {BPP}}\subseteq {\mathsf {MA}}\subseteq {\mathsf {S}}_{2}^{P}\subseteq \Sigma _{2}\cap \Pi _{2}}
   (see MA, SP2).
