Digital morphogenesis is a type of generative art in which complex shape development, or morphogenesis, is enabled by computation. This concept is applicable in many areas of design, art, architecture, and modeling.  The concept was originally developed in the field of biology, later in geology, geomorphology, and architecture.  
In architecture, it describes tools and methods for creating forms and adapting them to a known environment.Developments in digital morphogenesis have allowed construction and analysis of structures in more detail than could have been put into a blueprint or model by hand, with structure at all levels defined by iterative algorithms.  As fabrication techniques advance, it is becoming possible to produce objects with fractal or other elaborate structures.
