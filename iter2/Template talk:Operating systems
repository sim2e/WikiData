I don't understand this part of the template:

Kernel:
General: Microkernel · Nanokernel 
Types: monolithic · hybrid · exokernel

What is "general"? General kernel designs are microkernel and monolithic kernel. A hybrid would then be one that possesses qualities of both. Exokernel is orthogonally different design, but it either fits in one or the other category. Nanokernel is a microkernel even more miniaturized. So there are two basic designs. Considering that, what does the above "general" and "types" mean? --Paxcoder (talk) 16:40, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

Nanokernel has been redirecting to Microkernel since 2008. Why is Nanokernel still listed as an architecture subtype when it is apparently not notable enough to get its own article? The Nanokernel-part of the Microkernel article looks a lot like a disambiguation-page; if Nanokernel doesn't even have a proper definition why does it count as a subtype? I suggest removing Nanokernel from the Operating system template.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 81.70.160.55 (talk) 16:41, 21 January 2012 (UTC) 

I believe long mode is more than prevalent to warrant its addition into the cpu modes field. (It is one after all!)
Edit: After I get to 10 edits :p

This is a highly visable template.  Please post your proposed changes here to get consensus before they are put in.  RudolfRed (talk) 03:59, 27 August 2013 (UTC)
The list of operating systems includes Oberon and a large collection of other OSes.  I understand it may look awkward to have such a long list under the "list" section of the template.  However, as is, it is confusing and inadequate.  Despite there is already a link on the left field to "list", there should also be a more... link at the end of the pseudo-full list that points to the true full list as well.

The one-word title "List" is ambiguous, but "List of operating systems" would surely seem redundant.

I cannot fathom why ORVYL is listed and, say, ITS is not.  What are the criteria for being promoted from List_of_operating_systems to the list in this template?
MatthewWilcox (talk) 19:55, 17 February 2019 (UTC)

I added Incompatible Timesharing System to the list, but I agree that some criteria for adding OSes to the template should be created because as far as I can tell it is currently very arbitrary. Perhaps based on install base and historical significance? (I have no idea how you would objectively measure the latter.) - PaulT+/C 08:25, 25 February 2019 (UTC)
Articles are generally titled singular; categories and navboxes are generally titled plural. I'd move it myself, but there's no "Move" button. I'm sure someone before me would have too; same problem. Someone locked down this page in 2010 with "‎[edit=autoconfirmed] (indefinite) [move=sysop] (indefinite)". So sysop please move this page (over redirect). - A876 (talk) 08:06, 14 June 2020 (UTC)

 Not done: page move requests should be made at Wikipedia:Requested moves. But the idea is good! TheImaCow (talk) 09:09, 14 June 2020 (UTC)
Just plain atrocious, to be honest. Redundant links to the same systems, horrible organization, impossible to read bloat. This template is a disaster that needs a total overhaul purely for usability purposes. I would take the time, but I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough about the subject beyond common knowledge to edit it confidently. But it's plainly a mess as any reader can see, and thereby fails at aiding in navigation, the purpose of a navbox. I think that readers would be better served by a single link to a better-organized list article myself. oknazevad (talk) 18:41, 21 June 2020 (UTC)

Given the existence of list of operating systems, is there a reason to even have a list of OSes in this template? Guy Harris (talk) 18:45, 21 June 2020 (UTC)
An argument can be made that there's a benefit to linking major common OSes via a navbox. The problem is this template has become bloated with barely notable historical OSes under the supposed need for NPOV, but that ignores the reality that including short-lives historical curiosities actually undermines the neutrality by giving undue focus to things with almost long-term significance. I once tried to argue against the initial bloating some years back, but clearly I didn't carry consensus. Frankly, the time since has only made it worse, and the recent attempts to clean up the template have made it unnavigable. Which, for a navigation template, is really bass ackward. oknazevad (talk) 00:18, 22 June 2020 (UTC)

I applaud the decision. This template failed to aid navigation, it's fundamental purpose. oknazevad (talk) 04:11, 31 July 2020 (UTC)
Yes, we don't need a list of lots of operating systems here; list of operating systems suffices. Guy Harris (talk) 05:58, 31 July 2020 (UTC)
