Articles containing older statements are more likely to be dated. This is not a backlog; not all articles in this category will need updating at this point in time.
Use {{As of}} to mark all individual statements that may become dated, this will automatically add them to the appropriate categories. Wherever possible, use {{Update after}} to mark exactly when statements will need updating in addition to using {{As of}}.
