A retronym is a newer name for an existing thing that helps differentiate the original form from a more recent one. It is thus a word or phrase created to avoid confusion between older and newer types, whereas previously (before there were more than one type) no clarification was required.Advances in technology are often responsible for the coinage of retronyms. For example, the term acoustic guitar was coined with the advent of electric guitars; analog watches were renamed to distinguish them from digital watches once the latter were invented; "push bike" was created to distinguish from motorbike and motorized bicycles; and finally "feature phone" was also coined behind smartphones.

Etymology
