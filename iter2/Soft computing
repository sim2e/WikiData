Soft computing is a set of algorithms, 
including neural networks, fuzzy logic, and evolutionary algorithms.
These algorithms are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation.
It is contrasted with hard computing: algorithms which find provably correct and optimal solutions to problems.

History
The theory and techniques related to soft computing were first introduced in 1980s. The term "soft computing" was coined by Lotfi A. Zadeh.
