This article describes the history of computing in Romania.

HC family
The Romanian computers HC family (HC 85, HC 85+, HC 88, HC 90, HC 91 and HC 2000) were clones of the ZX Spectrum produced at ICE Felix from 1985 to 1994. HC 85 was first designed at Institutul Politehnic București by Prof. Dr. Ing. Adrian Petrescu (in laboratory), then redesigned at ICE Felix (in order to be produced at industrial scale). Their operating system was a BASIC interpreter.

aMIC
aMIC (microcomputer) was a Romanian microcomputer designed by Prof. Adrian Petrescu at Institutul Politehnic București in 1982, later produced at Fabrica de Memorii in Timișoara.

MARICA and DACICC
MARICA and the DACICC family (DACICC-1 and DACICC-200) were Romanian computers produced in 1959–1968 at T. Popoviciu Institute of Numerical Analysis, Cluj-Napoca.

Felix series
Felix PC was a Romanian IBM-PC compatible produced at ICE Felix in 1985–1990.
Felix C was a family of Romanian computers produced by ICE Felix from 1970 to 1978. They were similar to IBM/360; their operating system was SIRIS.
Felix M was a family of Romanian mini and microcomputers in 1975–1984.

CoBra
CoBra was a Romanian personal computer produced at I.T.C.I Brașov, in 1986.

Independent
Independent minicomputer series was a series of Romanian minicomputers, manufactured from 1983 to 1989. They were compatible with DEC-PDP 11–34, running RSX-11M operating system. They were produced at ITC Timișoara, with memory chips also produced in Timișoara.
