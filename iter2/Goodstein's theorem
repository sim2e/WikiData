In mathematical logic, Goodstein's theorem is a statement about the natural numbers, proved by Reuben Goodstein in 1944, which states that every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Laurence Kirby and Jeff Paris showed that it is unprovable in Peano arithmetic (but it can be proven in stronger systems, such as second-order arithmetic). This was the third example of a true statement that is unprovable in Peano arithmetic, after the examples provided by Gödel's incompleteness theorem and Gerhard Gentzen's 1943 direct proof of the unprovability of ε0-induction in Peano arithmetic. The Paris–Harrington theorem gave another example.
Kirby and Paris introduced a graph-theoretic hydra game with behavior similar to that of Goodstein sequences: the "Hydra" (named for the mythological multi-headed Hydra of Lerna) is a rooted tree, and a move consists of cutting off one of its "heads" (a branch of the tree), to which the hydra responds by growing a finite number of new heads according to certain rules.  Kirby and Paris proved that the Hydra will eventually be killed, regardless of the strategy that Hercules uses to chop off its heads, though this may take a very long time. Just like for Goodstein sequences, Kirby and Paris showed that it cannot be proven in Peano arithmetic alone.

Hereditary base-n notation
Goodstein sequences are defined in terms of a concept called "hereditary base-n notation". This notation is very similar to usual base-n positional notation, but the usual notation does not suffice for the purposes of Goodstein's theorem.
To achieve the ordinary base-n notation, where n is a natural number greater than 1, an arbitrary natural number m is written as a sum of multiples of powers of n:

  
    
      
        m
        =
        
          a
          
            k
          
        
        
          n
          
            k
          
        
        +
        
          a
          
            k
            −
            1
          
        
        
          n
          
            k
            −
            1
          
        
        +
        ⋯
        +
        
          a
          
            0
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle m=a_{k}n^{k}+a_{k-1}n^{k-1}+\cdots +a_{0},}
  where each coefficient ai satisfies 0 ≤ ai < n, and ak ≠ 0. For example, to achieve the base 2 notation, one writes

  
    
      
        35
        =
        32
        +
        2
        +
        1
        =
        
          2
          
            5
          
        
        +
        
          2
          
            1
          
        
        +
        
          2
          
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 35=32+2+1=2^{5}+2^{1}+2^{0}.}
  Thus the base-2 representation of 35 is 100011, which means 25 + 2 + 1.  Similarly, 100 represented in base-3 is 10201:

  
    
      
        100
        =
        81
        +
        18
        +
        1
        =
        
          3
          
            4
          
        
        +
        2
        ⋅
        
          3
          
            2
          
        
        +
        
          3
          
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 100=81+18+1=3^{4}+2\cdot 3^{2}+3^{0}.}
  Note that the exponents themselves are not written in base-n notation. For example, the expressions above include 25 and 34, and 5 > 2, 4 > 3.
To convert a base-n notation (which is a step in achieving base-n representation) to a hereditary base-n notation, first rewrite all of the exponents as a sum of powers of n (with the limitation on the coefficients 0 ≤ ai < n). Then rewrite any exponent inside the exponents in base-n notation (with the same limitation on the coefficients), and continue in this way until every number appearing in the expression (except the bases themselves) is written in base-n notation.
For example, while 35 in ordinary base-2 notation is 25 + 2 + 1, it is written in hereditary base-2 notation as

  
    
      
        35
        =
        
          2
          
            
              2
              
                
                  2
                  
                    1
                  
                
              
            
            +
            1
          
        
        +
        
          2
          
            1
          
        
        +
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle 35=2^{2^{2^{1}}+1}+2^{1}+1,}
  using the fact that 5 = 221 + 1. Similarly, 100 in hereditary base-3 notation is

  
    
      
        100
        =
        
          3
          
            
              3

        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle 100=3^{3^{1}+1}+2\cdot 3^{2}+1.}

Goodstein sequences
The Goodstein sequence  G(m) of a number m is a sequence of natural numbers. The first element in the sequence G(m) is m itself. To get the second, G(m)(2), write m in hereditary base-2 notation, change all the 2s to 3s, and then subtract 1 from the result. In general, the (n + 1)-st term, G(m)(n + 1), of the Goodstein sequence of m is as follows:

Take the hereditary base-n + 1 representation of G(m)(n).
Replace each occurrence of the base-n + 1 with n + 2.
Subtract one. (Note that the next term depends both on the previous term and on the index n.)
Continue until the result is zero, at which point the sequence terminates.Early Goodstein sequences terminate quickly. For example, G(3) terminates at the 6th step:

Later Goodstein sequences increase for a very large number of steps. For example, G(4) OEIS: A056193 starts as follows:

Elements of G(4) continue to increase for a while, but at base

   steps, and then begin their descent.
However, even G(4) doesn't give a good idea of just how quickly the elements of a Goodstein sequence can increase.
G(19) increases much more rapidly and starts as follows:

In spite of this rapid growth, Goodstein's theorem states that every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0, no matter what the starting value is.

Proof of Goodstein's theorem
Goodstein's theorem can be proved (using techniques outside Peano arithmetic, see below) as follows: Given a Goodstein sequence G(m), we construct a parallel sequence P(m) of ordinal numbers in Cantor normal form which is strictly decreasing and terminates. A common misunderstanding of this proof is to believe that G(m) goes to 0 because it is dominated by P(m). Actually, the fact that P(m) dominates G(m) plays no role at all. The important point is: G(m)(k) exists if and only if P(m)(k) exists (parallelism), and comparison between two members of G(m) is preserved when comparing corresponding entries of P(m). Then if P(m) terminates, so does G(m). By infinite regress, G(m) must reach 0, which guarantees termination.
We define a function 
  
    
      
        f
        =
        f
        (
        u
        ,
        k
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f=f(u,k)}
   which computes the hereditary base k representation of u and then replaces each occurrence of the base k with the first infinite ordinal number ω. For example, 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        100
        ,
        3

  .
Each term P(m)(n) of the sequence P(m) is then defined as f(G(m)(n),n+1). For example, G(3)(1) = 3 = 21 + 20 and P(3)(1) = f(21 + 20,2) = ω1 + ω0 = ω + 1. Addition, multiplication and exponentiation of ordinal numbers are well defined.

    {\displaystyle \omega ^{\omega }-1}
   is not an ordinal.
Thus the sequence P(m) is strictly decreasing. As the standard order < on ordinals is well-founded, an infinite strictly decreasing sequence cannot exist, or equivalently, every strictly decreasing sequence of ordinals terminates (and cannot be infinite). But P(m)(n) is calculated directly from G(m)(n). Hence the sequence G(m) must terminate as well, meaning that it must reach 0.
While this proof of Goodstein's theorem is fairly easy, the Kirby–Paris theorem, which shows that Goodstein's theorem is not a theorem of Peano arithmetic, is technical and considerably more difficult. It makes use of countable nonstandard models of Peano arithmetic.

Extended Goodstein's theorem
Suppose the definition of the Goodstein sequence is changed so that instead of
replacing each occurrence of the base b with b + 1
it replaces it with b + 2. Would the sequence still terminate?
More generally, let b1, b2, b3, … be any sequences of integers.
Then let the (n + 1)-st
term G(m)(n + 1) of the extended Goodstein sequence of m be as
follows: take the hereditary base bn representation of
G(m)(n) and replace each occurrence of the base bn
with bn+1 and then subtract one.
The claim is that this sequence still terminates.
The extended proof defines P(m)(n) = f(G(m)(n), n) as
follows: take the hereditary base bn representation of
G(m)(n), and replace each occurrence of the base
bn with the first infinite ordinal number ω.
The base-changing operation of the Goodstein sequence when going
from G(m)(n) to G(m)(n + 1) still does not change the value of f.
For example, if bn = 4 and if bn+1 = 9,
then

Application to computable functions
Goodstein's theorem can be used to construct a total computable function that Peano arithmetic cannot prove to be total.  The Goodstein sequence of a number can be effectively enumerated by a Turing machine; thus the function which maps n to the number of steps required for the Goodstein sequence of n to terminate is computable by a particular Turing machine.  This machine merely enumerates the Goodstein sequence of n and, when the sequence reaches 0, returns the length of the sequence.  Because every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates, this function is total.   But because Peano arithmetic does not prove that every Goodstein sequence terminates, Peano arithmetic does not prove that this Turing machine computes a total function.
