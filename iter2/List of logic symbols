In logic, a set of symbols is commonly used to express logical representation. The following table lists many common symbols, together with their name, how they should be read out loud, and the related field of mathematics. Additionally, the subsequent columns contains an informal explanation, a short example, the Unicode location, the name for use in HTML documents, and the LaTeX symbol.

Advanced and rarely used logical symbols
These symbols are sorted by their Unicode value:

Usage in various countries
Poland
As of 2014 in Poland, the universal quantifier is sometimes written 
  
    
      
        ⋀
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigwedge }
  , and the existential quantifier as 
  
    
      
        ⋁
      
    
    {\displaystyle \bigvee }
  . The same applies for Germany.

Japan
The ⇒ symbol is often used in text to mean "result" or "conclusion", as in "We examined whether to sell the product ⇒ We will not sell it". Also, the → symbol is often used to denote "changed to", as in the sentence "The interest rate changed. March 20% → April 21%".
