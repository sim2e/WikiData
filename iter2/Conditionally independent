In probability theory, conditional independence describes situations wherein an observation is irrelevant or redundant when evaluating the certainty of a hypothesis. Conditional independence is usually formulated in terms of conditional probability, as a special case where the probability of the hypothesis given the uninformative observation is equal to the probability without. If 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is the hypothesis, and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   and 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   are observations, conditional independence can be stated as an equality:

  
    
      
        P
        (
        A
        ∣
        B
        ,
        C
        )
        =
        P
        (
        A
        ∣
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(A\mid B,C)=P(A\mid C)}
  where 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        A
        ∣
        B
        ,
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(A\mid B,C)}
   is the probability of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   given both 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   and 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  . Since the probability of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   given 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   is the same as the probability of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   given both 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   and 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  , this equality expresses that 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   contributes nothing to the certainty of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  . In this case, 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   are said to be conditionally independent given 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  , written symbolically as: 
  
    
      
        (
        A
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        B
        ∣
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (A\perp \!\!\!\perp B\mid C)}
  . In the language of causal equality notation, two functions 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(y)}
   and 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle g(y)}
   which both depend on a common variable 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   are described as conditionally independent using the notation 
  
    
      
        f
        
          (
          y
          )
        
         
        
          
            =
            
              ↶↷
            
          
        
         
        g
        
          (
          y
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\left(y\right)~{\overset {\curvearrowleft \curvearrowright }{=}}~g\left(y\right)}
  , which is equivalent to the notation 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        f
        ∣
        g
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        P
        (
        f
        ∣
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(f\mid g,y)=P(f\mid y)}
  .
The concept of conditional independence is essential to graph-based theories of statistical inference, as it establishes a mathematical relation between a collection of conditional statements and a graphoid.

Conditional independence of events
Let 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  , 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
  , and 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   be events. 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   are said to be conditionally independent given 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        C
        )
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(C)>0}
   and:

  
    
      
        P
        (
        A
        ∣
        B
        ,
        C
        )
        =
        P
        (
        A
        ∣
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(A\mid B,C)=P(A\mid C)}
  This property is often written: 
  
    
      
        (
        A
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        B
        ∣
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (A\perp \!\!\!\perp B\mid C)}
  , which should be read 
  
    
      
        (
        (
        A
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        B
        )
        |
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle ((A\perp \!\!\!\perp B)\vert C)}
  .
Equivalently, conditional independence may be stated as:

  
    
      
        P
        (
        A
        ,
        B
        
          |
        
        C
        )
        =
        P
        (
        A
        
          |
        
        C
        )
        P
        (
        B
        
          |
        
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(A,B|C)=P(A|C)P(B|C)}
  where 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        A
        ,
        B
        
          |
        
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(A,B|C)}
   is the joint probability of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   given 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  . This alternate formulation states that 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   are independent events, given 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
  .
It demonstrates that 
  
    
      
        (
        A
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        B
        ∣
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (A\perp \!\!\!\perp B\mid C)}
   is equivalent to 
  
    
      
        (
        B
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        A
        ∣
        C
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (B\perp \!\!\!\perp A\mid C)}
  .

Proximity and delays
Let events A and B be defined as the probability that person A and person B will be home in time for dinner where both people are randomly sampled from the entire world. Events A and B can be assumed to be independent i.e. knowledge that A is late has minimal to no change on the probability that B will be late. However, if a third event is introduced, person A and person B live in the same neighborhood, the two events are now considered not conditionally independent. Traffic conditions and weather-related events that might delay person A, might delay person B as well. Given the third event and knowledge that person A was late, the probability that person B will be late does meaningfully change.

Dice rolling
Conditional independence depends on the nature of the third event. If you roll two dice, one may assume that the two dice behave independently of each other. Looking at the results of one dice will not tell you about the result of the second dice. (That is, the two dice are independent.) If, however, the 1st dice's result is a 3, and someone tells you about a third event - that the sum of the two results is even - then this extra unit of information restricts the options for the 2nd result to an odd number. In other words, two events can be independent, but NOT conditionally independent.

Height and vocabulary
Height and vocabulary are dependent since very small people tend to be children, known for their more basic vocabularies. But knowing that two people are 19 years old (i.e., conditional on age) there is no reason to think that one person's vocabulary is larger if we are told that they are taller.

Conditional independence of random variables
Two discrete random variables

    {\displaystyle X}

        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}
   if and only if they are independent in their conditional probability distribution given 
  
    
      
        Z

  , the probability distribution of

   and the probability distribution of 
  
    
      
        Y

   if they are independent given σ(W): the σ-algebra generated by 
  
    
      
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle W}
  . This is commonly written:

  
    
      
        X
        ⊥

    {\displaystyle X\perp \!\!\!\perp Y\mid W}
   or

        Y
        ∣
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\perp Y\mid W}
  This it read "
  
    
      
        X

        ∣
        W

  ."
If 
  
    
      
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle W}
   assumes a countable set of values, this is equivalent to the conditional independence of X and Y for the events of the form 
  
    
      
        [
        W
        =
        w
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [W=w]}
  .
Conditional independence of more than two events, or of more than two random variables, is defined analogously.
The following two examples show that 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\perp \!\!\!\perp Y}
   neither implies nor is implied by 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        Y
        )
        ∣
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X\perp \!\!\!\perp Y)\mid W}
  .
First, suppose 
  
    
      
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle W}
   is 0 with probability 0.5 and 1 otherwise.  When W = 0 take 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   to be independent, each having the value 0 with probability 0.99 and the value 1 otherwise.  When 
  
    
      
        W
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle W=1}
  , 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   are again independent, but this time they take the value 1 with probability 0.99.  Then 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        Y
        )
        ∣
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X\perp \!\!\!\perp Y)\mid W}
  . But 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   are dependent, because Pr(X = 0) < Pr(X = 0|Y = 0).  This is because Pr(X = 0) = 0.5, but if Y = 0 then it's very likely that W = 0 and thus that X = 0 as well, so Pr(X = 0|Y = 0) > 0.5.
For the second example, suppose 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\perp \!\!\!\perp Y}
  , each taking the values 0 and 1 with probability 0.5. Let 
  
    
      
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle W}
   be the product 
  
    
      
        X
        ⋅
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\cdot Y}
  .  Then when 
  
    
      
        W
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle W=0}
  , Pr(X = 0) = 2/3, but Pr(X = 0|Y = 0) = 1/2, so 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        Y
        )
        ∣
        W
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X\perp \!\!\!\perp Y)\mid W}
   is false.
This is also an example of Explaining Away. See Kevin Murphy's tutorial  where 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   take the values "brainy" and "sporty".

Uses in Bayesian inference
Let p be the proportion of voters who will vote "yes" in an upcoming referendum. In taking an opinion poll, one chooses n voters randomly from the population. For i = 1, ..., n, let Xi = 1 or 0 corresponding, respectively, to whether or not the ith chosen voter will or will not vote "yes".
In a frequentist approach to statistical inference one would not attribute any probability distribution to p (unless the probabilities could be somehow interpreted as relative frequencies of occurrence of some event or as proportions of some population) and one would say that X1, ..., Xn are independent random variables.
By contrast, in a Bayesian approach to statistical inference, one would assign a probability distribution to p regardless of the non-existence of any such "frequency" interpretation, and one would construe the probabilities as degrees of belief that p is in any interval to which a probability is assigned. In that model, the random variables X1, ..., Xn are not independent, but they are conditionally independent given the value of p. In particular, if a large number of the Xs are observed to be equal to 1, that would imply a high conditional probability, given that observation, that p is near 1, and thus a high conditional probability, given that observation, that the next X to be observed will be equal to 1.

Rules of conditional independence
A set of rules governing statements of conditional independence have been derived from the basic definition.These rules were termed "Graphoid Axioms"
by Pearl and Paz, because they hold in graphs, where 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        A
        ∣
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\perp \!\!\!\perp A\mid B}
   is interpreted to mean: "All paths from X to A are intercepted by the set B".

  Proof

By assumption, 
  
    
      
        Pr
        (

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Pr(X)=\Pr(X\mid A,B)}
  .
Due to the property of decomposition 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊥

        Pr

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Pr(X)=\Pr(X\mid B)}
  .
Combining the above two equalities gives 
  
    
      
        Pr
        (

Technical note: since these implications hold for any probability space, they will still hold if one considers a sub-universe by conditioning everything on another variable, say K. For example, 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        Y
        ⇒
        Y
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\perp \!\!\!\perp Y\Rightarrow Y\perp \!\!\!\perp X}
   would also mean that 
  
    
      
        X
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        Y
        ∣
        K
        ⇒
        Y
        ⊥
        
        
        
        ⊥
        X
        ∣
        K
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\perp \!\!\!\perp Y\mid K\Rightarrow Y\perp \!\!\!\perp X\mid K}
  .
