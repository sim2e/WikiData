Cornell University Hospital for Animals
College founders taught and practiced veterinary medicine on Cornell's campus as early as 1896 and multiple clinical spaces were built over the years. Currently, the Cornell University Hospital for Animals is a collection of seven hospitals in New York and Connecticut.
Companion Animal Hospital
Cornell Equine Hospital
Cornell Ruffian Equine Specialists
Cornell University Veterinary Specialists
Janet L. Swanson Wildlife Hospital
Nemo Farm Animal Hospital
Small Animal Community PracticeThe current Ithaca space was built in 1996, and houses three of Cornell's animal hospitals: The Companion Animal Hospital, the Cornell Equine Hospital, and the Nemo Farm Animal Hospital. It's also the home of the hospital's Ambulatory Service, which makes on-site visits to dairies and farms throughout the region. The college opened Cornell's Small Animal Community Practice next door in 2018, which enables students to learn business and management skills, and is where Maddie's Â® Shelter Medicine Program at Cornell University primarily operates.
Also in Ithaca is the college's Janet L. Swanson Wildlife hospital, located in a nearby facility next to the Baker Institute for Animal Health and the Cornell Feline Health Center. Another clinical space near campus is the Cornell Equine Park, which primarily functions as a learning lab for veterinary students and researchers interested in theriogenology and/or sports medicine and rehabilitation.
In 2011, the college opened its first satellite hospital: Cornell University Veterinary Specialists, located in Stamford, Connecticut. This was followed in 2014 by the second satellite hospital: Cornell Ruffian Equine Specialists in Belmont, New York.In 2015 and 2016, some controversy at the college surrounded clinician care.According to the college's most recent annual report, the Cornell University Hospital for Animals saw 30,083 cases in fiscal year 2021.
