Should we put Ludwig Wittgenstein in this template?--Vojvodae please be free to write :) 18:17, 3 January 2010 (UTC)

So there are a ton of philosophers working in philosophy of mind. And a ton of them who aren't, but whose work is indirectly connected to philosophy of mind. It seems like a waste of time and effort to maintain a list of philosophers for this template. Should we just remove the list of philosophers from the template?

BabyJonas, I agree, avoids the POV of who goes in the template and who goes in the list article.  now removed. Frietjes (talk) 13:19, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
