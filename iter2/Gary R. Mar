Gary R. Mar is an American philosopher and logician specializing in logic, the philosophy of logic, the philosophy of mathematics, analytic philosophy, philosophy of language and linguistics, philosophy of science, computational philosophy, the philosophy of religion, and Asian American philosophy.  Professor Mar is a member of the Philosophy Department at Stony Brook University.  Gary Mar was the last student to have a Ph.D. directed by Alonzo Church.  He is co-author with Donald Kalish and Richard Montague of the second edition of  Logic: Techniques of Formal Reasoning.
He is also co-author of The Philosophical Computer with Patrick Grim and Paul St. Denis, which uses computer modelling to explore fractal images and chaos in semantic paradoxes.  This research was featured in a column  by Ian Stewart ('A Partly True Story,' in Scientific American (Feb. 1993, 110–112).  This research was also presented at the Kurt Gödel Centenary Symposium, Horizons of Truth at the University of Vienna in April 2006.
Gary Mar is the founding director of the Stony Brook Philosophy Department Logic Lab at Stony Brook and the founding director of the Asian American Center at Stony Brook, after being the catalyst for the donation of the Charles B. Wang Asian American Center at Stony Brook University, which at that time was the largest donation in the history of the public education system in New York State.
In 2003 he hosted a graduate seminar with Noam Chomsky through the President's Rotating Stars Program, and in 2005 he was instrumental in the awarding of an honorary doctorate to documentary filmmaker Loni Ding, whose landmark series Ancestors in the Americas [1] is an in-depth documentary on the history of Asians in the Americas.
Gary Mar has been the recipient of the Chancellor's and President's Award for Excellence in Teaching (1993), the Chancellor's Award for Excellence in University Service (2015), the Alumni Association Outstanding Professor Award (1995), a Pew Foundation Research Fellowship (1995–1996), and was a charter member Stony Brook's Academy of Scholar-Teachers (1996). As a graduate student, Gary Mar was a co-winner of the Rudolf Carnap Dissertation prize (UCLA, 1985).
