The Steane code is a tool in quantum error correction introduced by Andrew Steane in 1996. It is a CSS code (Calderbank-Shor-Steane), using the classical binary  [7,4,3] Hamming code to correct for qubit flip errors (X errors) and the dual of the Hamming code, the [7,3,4] code, to correct for phase flip errors (Z errors). The Steane code encodes one logical qubit in 7 physical qubits and is able to correct arbitrary single qubit errors.
Its check matrix in standard form is

Expression in the stabilizer formalism
In a quantum error-correcting code, the codespace is the subspace of the overall Hilbert space where all logical states live. In an 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -qubit stabilizer code, we can describe this subspace by its Pauli stabilizing group, the set of all 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -qubit Pauli operators which stabilize every logical state. The stabilizer formalism allows us to define the codespace of a stabilizer code by specifying its Pauli stabilizing group. We can efficiently describe this exponentially large group by listing its generators.
Since the Steane code encodes one logical qubit in 7 physical qubits, the codespace for the Steane code is a 
  
    
      
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2}
  -dimensional subspace of its 
  
    
      
        
          2
          
            7
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{7}}
  -dimensional Hilbert space.
In the stabilizer formalism, the Steane code has 6 generators:
