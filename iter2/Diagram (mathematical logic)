In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, the diagram of a structure is a simple but powerful concept for proving useful properties of a theory, for example the amalgamation property and the joint embedding property, among others.

Let 
  
    
      
        
          
            L
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}
   be a first-order language and 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   be a theory over 
  
    
      
        
          
            L

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}.}
   For a model

        T

   one expands 
  
    
      
        
          
            L

        :=

        A
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{A}:={\mathcal {L}}\cup \{c_{a}:a\in A\}}
  by adding a new constant symbol 
  
    
      
        
          c
          
            a

        a

        A

   where 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is a subset of the domain of
