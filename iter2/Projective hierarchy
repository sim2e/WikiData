In the mathematical field of descriptive set theory, a subset 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   of a Polish space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is projective if it is 
  
    
      
        
          
            Σ
          
          
            n

    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}_{n}^{1}}
   for some positive integer 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  .  Here 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is

        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is analytic

  
    
      
        
          
            Π
          
          
            n
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Pi }}_{n}^{1}}
   if the complement of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  , 
  
    
      
        X
        ∖
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\setminus A}
  , is 
  
    
      
        
          
            Σ
          
          
            n

            Σ
          
          
            n
            +
            1

    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}_{n+1}^{1}}
   if there is a Polish space 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   and a 
  
    
      
        
          
            Π
          
          
            n
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Pi }}_{n}^{1}}
   subset 
  
    
      
        C
        ⊆
        X
        ×
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle C\subseteq X\times Y}
   such that 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is the projection of 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   onto 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  ; that is, 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        {
        x
        ∈
        X
        ∣
        ∃
        y
        ∈
        Y
        :
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        ∈
        C
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=\{x\in X\mid \exists y\in Y:(x,y)\in C\}.}
  The choice of the Polish space 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   in the third clause above is not very important; it could be replaced in the definition by a fixed uncountable Polish space, say Baire space or Cantor space or the real line.

Relationship to the analytical hierarchy
There is a close relationship between the relativized analytical hierarchy on subsets of Baire space (denoted by lightface letters 
  
    
      
        Σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma }
   and 
  
    
      
        Π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Pi }
  ) and the projective hierarchy on subsets of Baire space (denoted by boldface letters 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          Π
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Pi }}}
  ).  Not every 
  
    
      
        
          
            Σ
          
          
            n
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}_{n}^{1}}
   subset of Baire space is 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            n
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{n}^{1}}
  .   It is true, however, that if a subset X of Baire space is 
  
    
      
        
          
            Σ
          
          
            n
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Sigma }}_{n}^{1}}
   then there is a set of natural numbers A such that X is 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            n
          
          
            1
            ,
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{n}^{1,A}}
  .    A similar statement holds for 
  
    
      
        
          
            Π
          
          
            n
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Pi }}_{n}^{1}}
   sets.   Thus the sets classified by the projective hierarchy are exactly the sets classified by the relativized version of the analytical hierarchy.    This relationship is important in effective descriptive set theory.
A similar relationship between the projective hierarchy and the relativized analytical hierarchy holds for subsets of Cantor space and, more generally, subsets of any effective Polish space.
