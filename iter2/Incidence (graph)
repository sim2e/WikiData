An incidence graph is a Levi graph.In graph theory, a vertex is incident with an edge if the vertex is one of the two vertices the edge connects.
An incidence is a pair 
  
    
      
        (
        u
        ,
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (u,e)}
   where 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
   is a vertex and 
  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
   is an edge incident with 
  
    
      
        u
      
    
    {\displaystyle u}
  
Two distinct incidences 
  
    
      
        (
        u
        ,
        e
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (u,e)}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        v
        ,
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (v,f)}
   are adjacent if either the vertices 
  
    
      
        u
        ,
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle u,v}
   or the edges 
  
    
      
        e
        ,
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle e,f}
   are adjacent, which is the case if one of the following holds:

  
    
      
        u
        =
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle u=v}
   and 
  
    
      
        e
        ≠
        f
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle e\neq f,}
  

  
    
      
        e
        =
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle e=f}
   and 
  
    
      
        u
        ≠
        v
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\neq v,}
   or

  
    
      
        e
        =
        {
        u
        ,
        v
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle e=\{u,v\}}
  , 
  
    
      
        f
        =
        {
        v
        ,
        w
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle f=\{v,w\}}
  , and 
  
    
      
        u
        ≠
        w
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle u\neq w.}
  An incidence coloring of a graph 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   is an assignment of a color to each incidence of G in such a way that adjacent incidences get distinct colors. It is equivalent to a strong edge coloring of the graph obtained by subdivising each edge of 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   once.
