In mathematics, particularly set theory, non-recursive ordinals are large countable ordinals greater than all the recursive ordinals, and therefore can not be expressed using recursive ordinal notations.

The Church–Kleene ordinal and variants
The smallest non-recursive ordinal is the Church Kleene ordinal,

    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}^{\mathsf {CK}}}
  , named after Alonzo Church and S. C. Kleene; its order type is the set of all recursive ordinals. Since the successor of a recursive ordinal is recursive, the Church–Kleene ordinal is a limit ordinal. It is also the smallest ordinal that is not hyperarithmetical, and the smallest admissible ordinal after
