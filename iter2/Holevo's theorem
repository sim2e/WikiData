Holevo's theorem is an important limitative theorem in quantum computing, an interdisciplinary field of physics and computer science. It is sometimes called Holevo's bound, since it establishes an upper bound to the amount of information that can be known about a quantum state (accessible information). It was published by Alexander Holevo in 1973.

Accessible information
As for several concepts in quantum information theory, accessible information is best understood in terms of a 2-party communication. So we introduce two parties, Alice and Bob. Alice has a classical random variable X, which can take the values {1, 2, ..., n} with corresponding probabilities {p1, p2, ..., pn}. Alice then prepares a quantum state, represented by the density matrix ρX chosen from a set {ρ1, ρ2, ... ρn}, and gives this state to Bob. Bob's goal is to find the value of X, and in order to do that, he performs a measurement on the state ρX, obtaining a classical outcome, which we denote with Y. In this context, the amount of accessible information, that is, the amount of information that Bob can get about the variable X, is the maximum value of the mutual information I(X : Y) between the random variables X and Y over all the possible measurements that Bob can do.There is currently no known formula to compute the accessible information. There are however several upper bounds, the best-known of which is the Holevo bound, which is specified in the following theorem.

Statement of the theorem
Let {ρ1, ρ2, ..., ρn} be a set of mixed states and let ρX be one of these states drawn according to the probability distribution P = {p1, p2, ..., pn}.
Then, for any measurement described by POVM elements {EY} and performed on 
  
    
      
        ρ
        =
        
          ∑
          
            X
          
        
        
          p
          
            X
          
        
        
          ρ
          
            X
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{X}p_{X}\rho _{X}}
  , the amount of accessible information about the variable X knowing the outcome Y of the measurement is bounded from above as follows:

  
    
      
        I
        (
        X
        :
        Y
        )
        ≤
        S
        (
        ρ
        )
        −
        
          ∑
          
            i
          
        
        
          p
          
            i

        (
        
          ρ
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle I(X:Y)\leq S(\rho )-\sum _{i}p_{i}S(\rho _{i})}
  where 
  
    
      
        ρ
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
          
        
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
        
          ρ
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}p_{i}\rho _{i}}
   and 
  
    
      
        S
        (
        ⋅
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S(\cdot )}
   is the von Neumann entropy.
The quantity on the right hand side of this inequality is called the Holevo information or Holevo χ quantity:

  
    
      
        χ
        :=
        S
        (
        ρ
        )
        −
        
          ∑
          
            i
          
        
        
          p
          
            i
          
        
        S
        (
        
          ρ
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \chi :=S(\rho )-\sum _{i}p_{i}S(\rho _{i})}
  .

  which completes the proof.

Comments and remarks
In essence, the Holevo bound proves that given n qubits, although they can "carry" a larger amount of (classical) information (thanks to quantum superposition), the amount of classical information that can be retrieved, i.e. accessed, can be only up to n classical (non-quantum encoded) bits. It was also established, both theoretically and experimentally, that there are computations where quantum bits carry more information through the process of the computation than is possible classically.
