In mathematics, in the study of iterated functions and dynamical systems, a periodic point of a function is a point which the system returns to after a certain number of function iterations or a certain amount of time.

Iterated functions
Given a mapping f from a set X into itself,

  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to X,}
  a point x in X is called periodic point if there exists an n>0 so that

  
    
      
         
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ f_{n}(x)=x}
  where fn is the nth iterate of f. The smallest positive integer n satisfying the above is called the prime period or least period of the point x. If every point in X is a periodic point with the same period n, then f is called periodic with period n (this is not to be confused with the notion of a periodic function).
If there exist distinct n and m such that

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          f
          
            m
          
        
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{n}(x)=f_{m}(x)}
  then x is called a preperiodic point. All periodic points are preperiodic.
If f is a diffeomorphism of a differentiable manifold, so that the derivative 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            n
          
          
            ′
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{n}^{\prime }}
   is defined, then one says that a periodic point is hyperbolic if

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
          
            ′
          
        
        
          |
        
        ≠
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle |f_{n}^{\prime }|\neq 1,}
  that it is attractive if

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
          
            ′
          
        
        
          |
        
        <
        1
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle |f_{n}^{\prime }|<1,}
  and it is repelling if

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          f
          
            n
          
          
            ′
          
        
        
          |
        
        >
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle |f_{n}^{\prime }|>1.}
  If the dimension of the stable manifold of a periodic point or fixed point is zero, the point is called a source; if the dimension of its unstable manifold is zero, it is called a sink; and if both the stable and unstable manifold have nonzero dimension, it is called a saddle or saddle point.

Examples
A period-one point is called a fixed point.
The logistic map 

exhibits periodicity for various values of the parameter r. For r between 0 and 1, 0 is the sole periodic point, with period 1 (giving the sequence 0, 0, 0, …, which attracts all orbits). For r between 1 and 3, the value 0 is still periodic but is not attracting, while the value 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                r
                −
                1
              
              r
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {r-1}{r}}}
   is an attracting periodic point of period 1. With r greater than 3 but less than 
  
    
      
        1
        +
        
          
            6
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1+{\sqrt {6}},}
   there are a pair of period-2 points which together form an attracting sequence, as well as the non-attracting period-1 points 0 and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                r
                −
                1
              
              r
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {r-1}{r}}.}
   As the value of parameter r rises toward 4, there arise groups of periodic points with any positive integer for the period; for some values of r one of these repeating sequences is attracting while for others none of them are (with almost all orbits being chaotic).

Dynamical system
Given a real global dynamical system 
  
    
      
        (
        
          R
        
        ,
        X
        ,
        Φ
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,X,\Phi ),}
   with X the phase space and Φ the evolution function,

  
    
      
        Φ
        :
        
          R
        
        ×
        X
        →
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Phi :\mathbb {R} \times X\to X}
  a point x in X is called periodic with period T if

  
    
      
        Φ
        (
        T
        ,
        x
        )
        =
        x
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Phi (T,x)=x\,}
  The smallest positive T with this property is called prime period of the point x.

Properties
Given a periodic point x with period T, then 
  
    
      
        Φ
        (
        t
        ,
        x
        )
        =
        Φ
        (
        t
        +
        T
        ,
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Phi (t,x)=\Phi (t+T,x)}
   for all t in 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} .}
  
Given a periodic point x then all points on the orbit γx through x are periodic with the same prime period.
