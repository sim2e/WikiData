Harm is a moral and legal concept with multiple definitions. It generally functions as a synonym for evil or anything that is bad under certain moral systems.
Moral Philosopher Bernard Gert construed harm (or "evil") as any of the following:
pain
death
disability
mortality
loss of ability or freedom
loss of pleasure.Joel Feinberg gives an account of harm as setbacks to interests.  He distinguishes welfare interests from ulterior interests.  Hence on his view there are two kinds of harm.
Welfare interests are 

interests in the continuance for a foreseeable interval of one's life, and the interests in one's own physical health and vigor, the integrity and normal functioning of one's body, the absence of absorbing pain and suffering or grotesque disfigurement, minimal intellectual acuity, emotional stability, the absence of groundless anxieties and resentments, the capacity to engage normally in social intercourse and to enjoy and maintain friendships, at least minimal income and financial security, a tolerable social and physical environment, and a certain amount of freedom from interference and coercion.
Ulterior interests are "a person's more ultimate goals and aspirations", such as "producing good novels or works of art, solving a crucial scientific problem, achieving high political office, successfully raising a family".
