Charles F. Berman Field is a natural turf soccer field in Ithaca, New York on the campus of Cornell University.

Description
Charles F. Berman Field is located along Tower Road across from Rice Hall. Measuring 118 yards by 74 yards, it is situated inside the William E. Simon running track. The grass playing surface is a mix of 30 percent rye and 70 percent Kentucky bluegrass, which was chosen for its "adaptability to close mowing."Constructed in 2000, the 1,000 seat stadium is named in honor of former Cornell soccer player Charles F. Berman who was captain of the 1948 Cornell soccer team and a member of the Quill and Dagger society. Berman perished in an airplane crash in Jamaica en route to Colombia on January 21, 1960.
