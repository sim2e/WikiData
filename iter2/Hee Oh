Hee Oh (Korean: 오희, born 1969) is a South Korean mathematician who works in dynamical systems. She has made contributions to dynamics and its connections to number theory. She is a student of homogeneous dynamics and has worked extensively on counting and equidistribution for Apollonian circle packings, Sierpinski carpets and Schottky dances. She is currently the Abraham Robinson Professor of Mathematics at Yale University.

Career
She graduated with a bachelor's degree from Seoul National University in 1992 and obtained her Ph.D from Yale University in 1997 under the guidance of Gregory Margulis. She held several faculty positions, including ones at Princeton University, California Institute of Technology and Brown University, before joining the Department of Mathematics at Yale University as the first female tenured professor in Mathematics there. She will serve as Vice President of the American Mathematical Society, February 1, 2021 – January 31, 2024.

Honours
Hee Oh was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad in 2010, and gave a joint invited address at the 2012 AMS-MAA Joint Mathematics Meeting. In 2012 she became an inaugural fellow of the American Mathematical Society.  Since 2010, she has served on the scientific advisory board of the American Institute of Mathematics. She is the 2015 recipient of the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics. She was named MSRI Simons Professor for 2014-2015.
