4 (four) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number following 3 and preceding 5. It is a square number, the smallest semiprime and composite number, and is considered unlucky in many East Asian cultures.

Evolution of the Hindu-Arabic digit
Brahmic numerals represented 1, 2, and 3 with as many lines. 4 was simplified by joining its four lines into a cross that looks like the modern plus sign. The Shunga would add a horizontal line on top of the digit, and the Kshatrapa and Pallava evolved the digit to a point where the speed of writing was a secondary concern. The Arabs' 4 still had the early concept of the cross, but for the sake of efficiency, was made in one stroke by connecting the "western" end to the "northern" end; the "eastern" end was finished off with a curve. The Europeans dropped the finishing curve and gradually made the digit less cursive, ending up with a digit very close to the original Brahmin cross.While the shape of the character for the digit 4 has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the glyph usually has a descender, as, for example, in .
On the seven-segment displays of pocket calculators and digital watches, as well as certain optical character recognition fonts, 4 is seen with an open top: .Television stations that operate on channel 4 have occasionally made use of another variation of the "open 4", with the open portion being on the side, rather than the top. This version resembles the Canadian Aboriginal syllabics letter ᔦ. The magnetic ink character recognition "CMC-7" font also uses this variety of "4".

Mathematics
Four is the smallest composite number, its proper divisors being 1 and 2. Four is the sum and product of two with itself: 
  
    
      
        2
        +
        2
        =
        4
        =
        2
        ×
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2+2=4=2\times 2}
  , the only number 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   such that 
  
    
      
        a
        +
        a
        =
        b
        =
        a
        ×
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a+a=b=a\times a}
  , which also makes four the smallest and only even squared prime number 
  
    
      
        
          2
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{2}}
   and hence the first squared prime of the form 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p^{2}}
  , where 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is a prime. Four, as the first composite number, has a prime aliquot sum of 3; and as such it is part of the first aliquot sequence with a single composite member, expressly (4, 3, 1, 0).

  , and so forth, for any number of up arrows. By consequence, four is the only square one more than a prime number, specifically three.
The sum of the first four prime numbers two + three + five + seven is the only sum of four consecutive prime numbers that yields an odd prime number, seventeen, which is the fourth super-prime. Four lies between the first proper pair of twin primes, three and five, which are the first two Fermat primes, like seventeen, which is the third. On the other hand, the square of four (

            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 4^{2}}
  ), equivalently the fourth power of two (
  
    
      
        
          2
          
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{4}}
  ), is sixteen; the only number that has 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            b

   as a form of factorization.Holistically, there are four elementary arithmetic operations in mathematics: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷); and four basic number systems, the real numbers 
  
    
      
        
          R

Each natural number divisible by 4 is a difference of squares of two natural numbers, i.e. 
  
    
      
        4
        x
        =
        
          y
          
            2
          
        
        −
        
          z
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 4x=y^{2}-z^{2}}
  . A number is a multiple of 4 if its last two digits are a multiple of 4 (for example, 1092 is a multiple of 4 because 92 = 4 × 23).Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers. Three are not always sufficient; 7 for instance cannot be written as the sum of three squares.There are four all-Harshad numbers: 1, 2, 4, and 6. 12, which is divisible by four thrice over, is a Harshad number in all bases except octal.
A four-sided plane figure is a quadrilateral or quadrangle, sometimes also called a tetragon. It can be further classified as a rectangle or oblong, kite, rhombus, and square.
Four is the highest degree general polynomial equation for which there is a solution in radicals.The four-color theorem states that a planar graph (or, equivalently, a flat map of two-dimensional regions such as countries) can be colored using four colors, so that adjacent vertices (or regions) are always different colors. Three colors are not, in general, sufficient to guarantee this. The largest planar complete graph has four vertices.A solid figure with four faces as well as four vertices is a tetrahedron, which is the smallest possible number of faces and vertices a polyhedron can have. The regular tetrahedron, also called a 3-simplex, is the simplest Platonic solid. It has four regular triangles as faces that are themselves at dual positions with the vertices of another tetrahedron. Tetrahedra can be inscribed inside all other four Platonic solids, and tessellate space alongside the regular octahedron in the alternated cubic honeycomb.
The third dimension holds a total of four Coxeter groups that generate convex uniform polyhedra: the tetrahedral group, the octahedral group, the icosahedral group, and a dihedral group (of orders 24, 48, 120, and 4
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , respectively). There are also four general Coxeter groups of generalized uniform prisms, where two are hosoderal and dihedral groups that form spherical tilings, with another two general prismatic and antiprismatic groups that represent truncated hosohedra (or simply, prisms) and snub antiprisms, respectively.
Four-dimensional space is the highest-dimensional space featuring more than three regular convex figures: 

Two-dimensional: infinitely many regular polygons.
Three-dimensional: five regular polyhedra; the five Platonic solids which are the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.
Four-dimensional: six regular polychora; the 5-cell, 8-cell or tesseract, 16-cell, 24-cell, 120-cell, and 600-cell. The 24-cell, made of regular octahedra, has no analogue in any other dimension; it is self-dual, with its 24-cell honeycomb dual to the 16-cell honeycomb.
Five-dimensional and every higher dimension: three regular convex 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -polytopes, all within the infinite family of regular

  -hypercubes, and 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -orthoplexes.The fourth dimension is also the highest dimension where regular self-intersecting figures exist:

Two-dimensional: infinitely many regular star polygons.
Three-dimensional: four regular star polyhedra, the regular Kepler-Poinsot star polyhedra.
Four-dimensional: ten regular star polychora, the Schläfli–Hess star polychora. They contain cells of Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra alongside regular tetrahedra, icosahedra and dodecahedra.
Five-dimensional and every higher dimension: zero regular star-polytopes; uniform star polytopes in dimensions

   Coxeter groups, and extending to prismatic groups of uniform polyhedra, including one special non-Wythoffian form, the grand antiprism. Two infinite families of duoprisms and antiprismatic prisms exist in the fourth dimension.
There are only four polytopes with radial equilateral symmetry: the hexagon, the cuboctahedron, the tesseract, and the 24-cell. 
Four-dimensional differential manifolds have some unique properties. There is only one differential structure on

The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements; it is the Klein four-group. An alternating groups are not simple for values

There are four Hopf fibrations of hyperspheres:

They are defined as locally trivial fibrations that map 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        
          S

    {\displaystyle n=2,4,8}
   (aside from the trivial fibration mapping between two points and a circle).Further extensions of the real numbers under Hurwitz's theorem states that there are four normed division algebras: the real numbers 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  , the complex numbers 
  
    
      
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
  , the quaternions 
  
    
      
        
          H
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {H} }
  , and the octonions 
  
    
      
        
          O
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {O} }
  . Under Cayley–Dickson constructions, the sedenions 
  
    
      
        
          S
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {S} }
   constitute a further fourth extension over 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  . The real numbers are ordered, commutative and associative algebras, as well as alternative algebras with power-associativity. The complex numbers 
  
    
      
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
   share all four multiplicative algebraic properties of the reals 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  , without being ordered. The quaternions loose a further commutative algebraic property, while holding associative, alternative, and power-associative properties. The octonions are alternative and power-associative, while the sedenions are only power-associative. The sedenions and all further extensions of these four normed division algebras are solely power-associative with non-trivial zero divisors, which makes them non-division algebras. 
  
    
      
        
          R

The symbolic meanings of the number four are linked to those of the cross and the square. "Almost from prehistoric times, the number four was employed to signify what was solid, what could be touched and felt. Its relationship to the cross (four points) made it an outstanding symbol of wholeness and universality, a symbol which drew all to itself". Where lines of latitude and longitude intersect, they divide the earth into four proportions.

C. S. Peirce, usually a trichotomist, discussed four methods for overcoming troublesome uncertainties and achieving secure beliefs: (1) the method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief), (2) the method of authority, (3) the method of congruity (following a fashionable paradigm), and (4) the fallibilistic, self-correcting method of science (see "The Fixation of Belief", 1877); and four barriers to inquiry, barriers refused by the fallibilist: (1) assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena (see "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], 1899).

Karl Popper outlined a tetradic schema to describe the growth of theories and, via generalization, also the emergence of new behaviors and living organisms: (1) problem, (2) tentative theory, (3) (attempted) error-elimination (especially by way of critical discussion), and (4) new problem(s). (See Popper's Objective Knowledge, 1972, revised 1979.)
John Boyd (military strategist) made his key concept the decision cycle or OODA loop, consisting of four stages: (1) observation (data intake through the senses), (2) orientation (analysis and synthesis of data), (3) decision, and (4) action.
