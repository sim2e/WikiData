In linear algebra, the Laplace expansion, named after Pierre-Simon Laplace, also called cofactor expansion, is an expression of the determinant of an n × n matrix B as a weighted sum of minors, which are the determinants of some (n − 1) × (n − 1) submatrices of B. Specifically, for every i, the Laplace expansion along the ith row is the equality

where 
  
    
      
        
          b
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle b_{i,j}}
   is the entry of the ith row and jth column of B, and 
  
    
      
        
          m
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle m_{i,j}}
   is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the ith row and the jth column of B. Similarly, the Laplace expansion along the jth column is the equality

(Each identity implies the other, since the determinants of a matrix and its transpose are the same.)

    {\displaystyle (-1)^{i+j}m_{i,j}}
   is called the cofactor of 
  
    
      
        
          B
          
            i

    {\displaystyle B_{i,j}}
   in B.
The Laplace expansion is often useful in proofs, as in, for example, allowing recursion on the size of matrices. It is also of didactic interest for its simplicity and as one of several ways to view and compute the determinant. For large matrices, it quickly becomes inefficient to compute when compared to Gaussian elimination.

Examples
Consider the matrix

  
    
      
        B
        =
        
          
            [
            
              
                
                  1
                
                
                  2
                
                
                  3
                
              
              
                
                  4
                
                
                  5
                
                
                  6
                
              
              
                
                  7
                
                
                  8
                
                
                  9
                
              
            
            ]
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle B={\begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\4&5&6\\7&8&9\end{bmatrix}}.}
  The determinant of this matrix can be computed by using the Laplace expansion along any one of its rows or columns. For instance, an expansion along the first row yields:

  It is easy to verify that the result is correct: the matrix is singular because the sum of its first and third column is twice the second column, and hence its determinant is zero.

  from which the result follows.  Similarly, the result holds if the index of the outer summation was replaced with 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  .

  The determinant of this matrix can be computed by using the Laplace's cofactor expansion along the first two rows as follows. Firstly note that there are 6 sets of two distinct numbers in {1, 2, 3, 4}, namely let 
  
    
      
        S
        =

This coincides with the theorem above when 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=1}
  . The same thing holds for any fixed k columns.

Computational expense
The Laplace expansion is computationally inefficient for high-dimension matrices, with a time complexity in big O notation of O(n!). Alternatively, using a decomposition into triangular matrices as in the LU decomposition can yield determinants with a time complexity of O(n3). The following Python code implements Laplace expansion recursively:
