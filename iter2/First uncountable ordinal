In mathematics, the first uncountable ordinal, traditionally denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   or sometimes by 
  
    
      
        Ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega }
  , is the smallest ordinal number that, considered as a set, is uncountable. It is the supremum (least upper bound) of all countable ordinals. When considered as a set, the elements of 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   are the countable ordinals (including finite ordinals), of which there are uncountably many.
Like any ordinal number (in von Neumann's approach), 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   is a well-ordered set, with set membership serving as the order relation. 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   is a limit ordinal, i.e. there is no ordinal 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
        =
        α
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}=\alpha +1}
  .
The cardinality of the set 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   is the first uncountable cardinal number, 
  
    
      
        
          ℵ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \aleph _{1}}
   (aleph-one). The ordinal 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   is thus the initial ordinal of 
  
    
      
        
          ℵ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \aleph _{1}}
  . Under the continuum hypothesis, the cardinality of 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   is 
  
    
      
        
          ℶ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beth _{1}}
  , the same as that of 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  —the set of real numbers.In most constructions, 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          ℵ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \aleph _{1}}
   are considered equal as sets. To generalize: if 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is an arbitrary ordinal, we define 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{\alpha }}
   as the initial ordinal of the cardinal 
  
    
      
        
          ℵ
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \aleph _{\alpha }}
  .
The existence of 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   can be proven without the axiom of choice. For more, see Hartogs number.

Topological properties
Any ordinal number can be turned into a topological space by using the order topology. When viewed as a topological space, 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   is often written as 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\omega _{1})}
  , to emphasize that it is the space consisting of all ordinals smaller than 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
  .
If the axiom of countable choice holds, every increasing ω-sequence of elements of 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\omega _{1})}
   converges to a limit in 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\omega _{1})}
  . The reason is that the union (i.e., supremum) of every countable set of countable ordinals is another countable ordinal.
The topological space 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\omega _{1})}
   is sequentially compact, but not compact. As a consequence, it is not metrizable. It is, however, countably compact and thus not Lindelöf (a countably compact space is compact if and only if it is Lindelöf). In terms of axioms of countability, 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\omega _{1})}
   is first-countable, but neither separable nor second-countable. 
The space 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
        ]
        =
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,\omega _{1}]=\omega _{1}+1}
   is compact and not first-countable. 
  
    
      
        
          ω
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
   is used to define the long line and the Tychonoff plank—two important counterexamples in topology.
