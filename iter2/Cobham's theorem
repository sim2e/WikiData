Cobham's theorem is a theorem in combinatorics on words that has important connections with number theory, notably transcendental numbers, and automata theory. Informally, the theorem gives the condition for the members of a set S of natural numbers written in bases b1 and base b2 to be recognised by finite automata. Specifically, consider bases b1 and b2 such that they are not powers of the same integer. Cobham's theorem states that S written in bases b1 and b2 is recognised by finite automata if and only if S is a finite union of arithmetic progressions. The theorem was proved by Alan Cobham in 1969 and has since given rise to many extensions and generalisations.

Two positive integers

          8
          
            4
          
        
        =
        
          16
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 8^{4}=16^{3}}
  . Two integers are multiplicatively dependent if and only if they are powers of a same third integer.

Problem statements
Original problem statement
More equivalent statements of the theorem have been given. The original version by Cobham is the following: Another way to state the theorem is by using automatic sequences. Cobham himself calls them "uniform tag sequences.". The following form is found in Allouche and Shallit's book:We can show that the characteristic sequence of a set of natural numbers S recognisable by finite automata in base k is a k-automatic sequence and that conversely, for all k-automatic sequences

        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq i<k}
  , the set 
  
    
      
        
          S

Formulation in logic
Cobham's theorem can be formulated in first-order logic using a theorem proven by Büchi in 1960. This formulation in logic allows for extensions and generalisations. The logical expression uses the theory

  .
Examples:

The set of odd numbers is definable (without 
  
    
      
        
          V

        )
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{2}(x)=x}
  .We can push the analogy with logic further by noting that S is first-order definable in Presburger arithmetic if and only if it is ultimately periodic. So, a set S is definable in the logics 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        N

        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle N,+,V_{k}\rangle }
   and 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        N
        ,
        +
        ,
        
          V
          
            ℓ
          
        
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle N,+,V_{\ell }\rangle }
   if and only if it is definable in Presburger arithmetic.

Generalisations
Approach by morphisms
An automatic sequence is a particular morphic word, whose morphism is uniform, meaning that the length of the images generated by the morphism for each letter of its input alphabet is the same. A set of integers is hence k-recognisable if and only if its characteristic sequence is generated by a uniform morphism followed by a coding, where a coding is a morphism that maps each letter of the input alphabet to a letter of the output alphabet. For example, the characteristic sequence of the powers of 2 is produced by the 2-uniform morphism (meaning each letter is mapped to a word of length 2) over the alphabet

        ⋯
      
    
    {\displaystyle a11010001\cdots }

A last definition: a Perron number is an algebraic number 
  
    
      
        z

        1

        {
        
          z
          ′

          C
        
        ,
        
          |

        <
        z
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{z'\in \mathbb {C} ,|z'|<z\}}
  . These are exactly the dominant eigenvalues of the primitive matrices of positive integers.

We then have the following statement:

Logic approach
The logic equivalent permits to consider more general situations: the automatic sequences over the natural numbers 
  
    
      
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }
   or recognisable sets have been extended to the integers 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }
  , to the Cartesian products 
  
    
      
        
          
            N
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} ^{m}}
  , to the real numbers 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
   and to the Cartesian products 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}}

Extension to 
  
    
      
        
          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }
  We code the base 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   integers by prepending to the representation of a positive integer the digit 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
  , and by representing negative integers by 
  
    
      
        k
        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle k-1}
   followed by the number's 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  -complement. For example, in base 2, the integer 
  
    
      
        −
        6
        =
        −
        8
        +
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle -6=-8+2}
   is represented as 
  
    
      
        1010
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1010}
  . The powers of 2 are written as 
  
    
      
        
          010
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 010^{*}}
  , and their negatives 
  
    
      
        
          110
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 110^{*}}
   (since 
  
    
      
        11000
      
    
    {\displaystyle 11000}
   is the representation of 
  
    
      
        −
        16
        +
        8
        =
        −
        8
      
    
    {\displaystyle -16+8=-8}
  ).

Extension to 
  
    
      
        
          
            N
          
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} ^{m}}
  A subset 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   of 
  
    
      
        
          N
          
            m
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N^{m}}
   is recognisable in base 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   if the elements of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  , written as vectors with 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   components, are recognisable over the resulting alphabet.

For example, in base 2, we have 
  
    
      
        3
        =
        
          11
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 3=11_{2}}
   and

        =
        
          1001

Proofs
Samuel Eilenberg announced the theorem without proof in his book; he says "The proof is correct, long, and hard. It is a challenge to find a more reasonable proof of this fine theorem." Georges Hansel proposed a more simple proof, published in the not-easily accessible proceedings of a conference. The proof of Dominique Perrin and that of Allouche and Shallit's book contains the same error in one of the lemmas, mentioned in the list of errata of the book. This error was uncovered in a note by Tomi Kärki, and corrected by Michel Rigo and Laurent Waxweiler. This part of the proof has been recently written.In January 2018, Thijmen J. P. Krebs announced, on Arxiv, a simplified proof of the original theorem, based on Dirichlet's approximation criterion instead of that of Kronecker; the article appeared in 2021. The employed method has been refined and used by Mol, Rampersad, Shallit and Stipulanti.
