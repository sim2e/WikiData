Pierre Baldi is a distinguished professor of computer science at University of California Irvine and the director of its Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics.

Education and early life
Born in Rome (Italy), Pierre Baldi received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees at the University of Paris, in France. He then obtained his Ph.D. degree in mathematics at the California Institute of Technology in 1986 supervised by R. M. Wilson.

Career and research
From 1986 to 1988, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego. From 1988 to 1995, he held faculty and member of the technical staff positions at the California Institute of Technology and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he was awarded the Lew Allen Award for Excellence in 1993. He was CEO of a start up company called Net-ID from 1995 to 1999 and joined University of California, Irvine in 1999.Baldi's research is focused on understanding intelligence in brains and machines, through the study of the mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning, and their applications to problems in the natural sciences, physics, chemistry, and biology.
