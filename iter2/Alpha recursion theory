In recursion theory, α recursion theory is a generalisation of recursion theory to subsets of admissible ordinals 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  .  An admissible set is closed under 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            1
          
        
        (
        
          L
          
            α
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}(L_{\alpha })}
   functions, where 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ξ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{\xi }}
   denotes a rank of Godel's constructible hierarchy. 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is an admissible ordinal if 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{\alpha }}
   is a  model of Kripke–Platek set theory.  In what follows 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is considered to be fixed.
The objects of study in 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   recursion are subsets of 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  . These sets are said to have some properties:

A set 
  
    
      
        A
        ⊆
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\subseteq \alpha }
   is said to be 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  -recursively-enumerable if it is 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}}
   definable over 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{\alpha }}
  , possibly with parameters from 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{\alpha }}
   in the definition.
A is 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  -recursive if both A and 
  
    
      
        α
        ∖
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha \setminus A}
   (its relative complement in 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  ) are 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  -recursively-enumerable. It's of note that 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  -recursive sets are members of

   by definition of 
  
    
      
        L

  .

    {\displaystyle L_{\alpha }}
   are called 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  -finite and play a similar role to the finite numbers in classical recursion theory.

        ,
        ∈
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L_{\alpha },\in )}
  .
A function mapping 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   to 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is 
  
    
      
        α

   to

          Σ
          
            n

        ,
        ∈
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L_{\alpha },\in )}
  .Additional connections between recursion theory and α recursion theory can be drawn, although explicit definitions may not have yet been written to formalize them:

The functions 
  
    
      
        
          Δ
          
            0

  -definable in

          L
          
            α
          
        
        ,
        ∈
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (L_{\alpha },\in )}
   play a role similar to those of the primitive recursive functions.We say R is a reduction procedure if it is 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   recursively enumerable and every member of R is of the form 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        H
        ,
        J
        ,
        K
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle H,J,K\rangle }
   where H, J, K are all α-finite.
A is said to be α-recursive in B if there exist 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            0

   reduction procedures such that:

  
    
      
        K
        ⊆
        A

        ]
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle K\subseteq A\leftrightarrow \exists H:\exists J:[\langle H,J,K\rangle \in R_{0}\wedge H\subseteq B\wedge J\subseteq \alpha /B],}

        J

        ∈
        
          R
          
            1
          
        
        ∧

        α
        
          /
        
        B
        ]
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle K\subseteq \alpha /A\leftrightarrow \exists H:\exists J:[\langle H,J,K\rangle \in R_{1}\wedge H\subseteq B\wedge J\subseteq \alpha /B].}
  If A is recursive in B this is written 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            ≤
            
              α
            
          
          B
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle A\leq _{\alpha }B}
  .  By this definition A is recursive in 
  
    
      
        
          ∅
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \varnothing }
   (the empty set) if and only if A is recursive.  However A being recursive in B is not equivalent to A being 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            1
          
        
        (
        
          L
          
            α
          
        
        [
        B
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}(L_{\alpha }[B])}
  .
We say A is regular if 
  
    
      
        ∀
        β
        ∈
        α
        :
        A
        ∩
        β
        ∈
        
          L
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall \beta \in \alpha :A\cap \beta \in L_{\alpha }}
   or in other words if every initial portion of A is α-finite.

Relationship to analysis
Some results in 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  -recursion can be translated into similar results about second-order arithmetic. This is because of the relationship 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   has with the ramified analytic hierarchy, an analog of 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   for the language of second-order arithmetic, that consists of sets of integers.In fact, when dealing with first-order logic only, the correspondence can be close enough that for some results on 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ω
          
        
        =
        
          
            HF
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{\omega }={\textrm {HF}}}
  , the arithmetical and Levy hierarchies can become interchangeable. For example, a set of natural numbers is definable by a 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            1
          
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}^{0}}
   formula iff it's 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}}
  -definable on 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            ω
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle L_{\omega }}
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}}
   is a level of the Levy hierarchy. More generally, definability of a subset of ω over HF with a 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{n}}
   formula coincides with its arithmetical definability using a 
  
    
      
        
          Σ
          
            n
          
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Sigma _{n}^{0}}
   formula.
