I created this navigation box because that is what I do.  I am not a nature expert.  Please add/change/delete as appropriate.--Old Hoss 00:53, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
I'm not sure that a template should include a "See also" heading.  Have a look at the bottom of Universe, and its index - there are two "see also" sections in that article now! Mitch Ames (talk) 12:38, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

I don't know if this runs too away from the context, but I think that adding 2 more rowos inside "Life" topic, one for "phiscology and mind" and another for Social Interaction is trully good!

The Nature portal was recently deleted. I've removed the red link from the template. BlackcurrantTea (talk) 08:17, 29 April 2019 (UTC)
