Televised series

Note that anime franchises with multiple television series (e.g. Pretty Cure) will be listed on this page. However, anime in Japan has a practice of naming seasons under their own separate title instead of by cours (e.g. K-On! versus K-On!! etc.). This article will only cover series without distinct season names.
