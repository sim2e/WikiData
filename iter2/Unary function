In mathematics, a unary function is a function that takes one argument. A unary operator belongs to a subset of unary functions, in that its range coincides with its domain. In contrast, a unary function's domain may or may not coincide with its range.

Examples
The successor function, denoted 
  
    
      
        succ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {succ} }
  , is a unary operator. Its domain and codomain are the natural numbers; its definition is as follows:

In many programming languages such as C, executing this operation is denoted by postfixing 
  
    
      
        
          
            +
            
              +
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathrel {+{+}}}}
   to the operand, i.e. the use of 
  
    
      
        n
        
          
            +
            
              +
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n{\mathrel {+{+}}}}
   is equivalent to executing the assignment 
  
    
      
        n
        :=
        succ
        ‚Å°
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle n:=\operatorname {succ} (n)}
  .
Many of the elementary functions are unary functions, including the trigonometric functions, logarithm with a specified base, exponentiation to a particular power or  base, and hyperbolic functions.
