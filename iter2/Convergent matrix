In linear algebra, a convergent matrix is a matrix that converges to the zero matrix under matrix exponentiation.

Background
When successive powers of a matrix T become small (that is, when all of the entries of T approach zero, upon raising T to successive powers), the matrix T converges to the zero matrix.  A regular splitting of a non-singular matrix A results in a convergent matrix T.  A semi-convergent splitting of a matrix A results in a semi-convergent matrix T.  A general iterative method converges for every initial vector if T is convergent, and under certain conditions if T is semi-convergent.

Definition
We call an n × n matrix T a convergent matrix if

for each i = 1, 2, ..., n and j = 1, 2, ..., n.

Iterative methods
A general iterative method involves a process that converts the system of linear equations

into an equivalent system of the form

for some matrix T and vector c.  After the initial vector x(0) is selected, the sequence of approximate solution vectors is generated by computing

for each k ≥ 0.   For any initial vector x(0) ∈ 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
  , the sequence 
  
    
      
        {
        
          
            x
          
          
            
              (
              k
              )
            
          
        
        
          }
          
            k
            =
            0
          
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lbrace \mathbf {x} ^{\left(k\right)}\rbrace _{k=0}^{\infty }}
   defined by (4), for each k ≥ 0 and c ≠ 0, converges to the unique solution of (3) if and only if ρ(T) < 1, that is, T is a convergent matrix.

Regular splitting
A  matrix splitting is an expression which represents a given matrix as a sum or difference of matrices.  In the system of linear equations (2) above, with A non-singular, the matrix A can be split, that is, written as a difference

so that (2) can be re-written as (4) above.  The expression (5) is a regular splitting of A if and only if B−1 ≥ 0 and C ≥ 0, that is, B−1 and C have only nonnegative entries.  If the splitting (5) is a regular splitting of the matrix A and A−1 ≥ 0, then ρ(T) < 1 and T is a convergent matrix.  Hence the method (4) converges.

Semi-convergent matrix
We call an n × n matrix T a semi-convergent matrix if the limit

exists.  If A is possibly singular but (2) is consistent, that is, b is in the range of A, then the sequence defined by (4) converges to a solution to (2) for every x(0) ∈ 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
   if and only if T is semi-convergent.  In this case, the splitting (5) is called a semi-convergent splitting of A.
