David Alexander Vogan, Jr. (born September 8, 1954) is a mathematician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who works on unitary representations of simple Lie groups.
While studying at the University of Chicago, he became a Putnam Fellow in 1972. He received his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in 1976, under the supervision of Bertram Kostant. In his thesis, he introduced the notion of lowest K type in the course of obtaining
an algebraic classification of irreducible Harish Chandra modules.  He is currently one of the participants in the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations.
Vogan was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996.  He served as Head of the Department of Mathematics at MIT from 1999 to 2004.
In 2012 he became Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He was president of the AMS in 2013–2014.  He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2013.
He was the Norbert Wiener Chair of Mathematics at MIT until his retirement in 2020.
