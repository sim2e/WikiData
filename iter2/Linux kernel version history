This article documents the version history of the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is a free and open-source, monolithic, Unix-like operating system kernel. It was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.Linux kernels have different support levels depending on the version. Usually, each stable version continues to backport bug fixes from the mainline until the next stable version is released. However, if a stable version has been designated as a long-term support (LTS) kernel, it will be maintained for an extra few years. After that, versions designated as Super-Long-Term Support (SLTS) will then be maintained by the Civil Infrastructure Platform (CIP) for many more years.

Releases 6.x.y
Releases 5.x.y
Releases 4.x.y
Releases 3.x.y
The jump from 2.6.x to 3.x wasn't because of a breaking update, but rather the first release of a new versioning scheme introduced as a more convenient system.

Releases 2.6.x.y
Versions 2.6.16 and 2.6.27 of the Linux kernel were unofficially given long-term support (LTS), before a 2011 working group in the Linux Foundation started a formal long-term support initiative.
