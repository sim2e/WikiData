The one-way or measurement-based quantum computer (MBQC) is a method of quantum computing that first prepares an entangled resource state, usually a cluster state or graph state, then performs single qubit measurements on it.  It is "one-way" because the resource state is destroyed by the measurements.
The outcome of each individual measurement is random, but they are related in such a way that the computation always succeeds. In general, the choices of basis for later measurements need to depend on the results of earlier measurements, and hence the measurements cannot all be performed at the same time.
The hardware implementation of MBQC mainly relies on photonic devices, due to the difficulty of entangling photons without measurements, and the relative simplicity of creating and measuring them. However, MBQC is also possible with matter-based qubits. The process of entanglement and measurement can be described with the help of graph tools and group theory, in particular by the elements from the stabilizer group.

Definition
The purpose of quantum computing focuses on building an information theory with the features of quantum mechanics: instead of encoding a binary unit of information (bit), which can be switched to 1 or 0, a quantum binary unit of information (qubit) can simultaneously turn to be 0 and 1 at the same time, thanks to the phenomenon called superposition. Another key feature for quantum computing relies on the entanglement between the qubits.
In the quantum logic gate model, a set of qubits, called register, is prepared at the beginning of the computation, then a set of logic operations over the qubits, carried by unitary operators, is implemented. A quantum circuit is formed by a register of qubits on which unitary transformations are applied over the qubits. In the measurement-based quantum computation, instead of implementing a logic operation via unitary transformations, the same operation is executed by entangling a number 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   of input qubits with a cluster of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   ancillary qubits, forming an overall source state of 
  
    
      
        a
        +
        k
        =
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle a+k=n}
   qubits, and then measuring a number 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   of them. The remaining 
  
    
      
        k
        =
        n
        −
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle k=n-a}
   output qubits will be affected by the measurements because of the entanglement with the measured qubits. The one-way computer has been proved to be a universal quantum computer, which means it can reproduce any unitary operation over an arbitrary number of qubits.

General procedure
The standard process of measurement-based quantum computing consists of three steps: entangle the qubits, measure the ancillae (auxiliary qubits) and correct the outputs. In the first step, the qubits are entangled in order to prepare the source state. In the second step, the ancillae are measured, affecting the state of the output qubits. However, the measurement outputs are non-deterministic result, due to undetermined nature of quantum mechanics: in order to carry on the computation in a deterministic way, some correction operators, called byproducts, are introduced.

Preparing the source state
At the beginning of the computation, the qubits can be distinguished into two categories: the input and the ancillary qubits. The inputs represent the qubits set in a generic 
  
    
      
        
          |

    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle =\alpha |0\rangle +\beta |1\rangle }
   state, on which some unitary transformations are to be acted. In order to prepare the source state, all the ancillary qubits must be prepared in the

Correcting the output
After all the measurements have been performed, the system has been reduced to a smaller number of qubits, which form the output state of the system. Due to the probabilistic outcome of measurements, the system is not set in a deterministic way: after a measurement on the 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  -
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   plane, the output may change whether the outcome had been 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        
          θ

        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\theta _{-}\rangle }
  . In order to perform a deterministic computation, some corrections must be introduced. The correction operators, or byproduct operators, are applied to the output qubits after all the measurements have been performed. The byproduct operators which can be implemented are 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}
  .  Depending on the outcome of the measurement, a byproduct operator can be applied or not to the output state: a

          |
        
        
          θ

        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\theta _{-}\rangle }
  . In the first case, no correction will occur, in the latter one a 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   operator will be implemented on the 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  -th qubit. Eventually, even though the outcome of a measurement is not deterministic in quantum mechanics, the results from measurements can be used in order to perform corrections, and carry on a deterministic computation.

CME pattern
The operations of entanglement, measurement and correction can be performed in order to implement unitary gates. Such operations can be performed time by time for any logic gate in the circuit, or rather in a pattern which allocates all the entanglement operations at the beginning, the measurements in the middle and the corrections at the end of the circuit. Such pattern of computation is referred to as CME standard pattern. In the CME formalism, the operation of entanglement between the

    {\displaystyle i}
   and

An example: Euler rotations
As an illustrative example, consider the Euler rotation in the 
  
    
      
        X
        Z
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle XZX}
   basis: such operation, in the gate model of quantum computation, is described as

  
    
      
        
          e

        (
        ϕ
        )

            Z

        )
        
          R
          
            X
          
        
        (
        λ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{i\gamma }R_{X}(\phi )R_{Z}(\theta )R_{X}(\lambda )}
  ,where 
  
    
      
        ϕ

        θ
        ,
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi ,\theta ,\lambda }
   are the angles for the rotation, while 
  
    
      
        γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma }
   defines a global phase which is irrelevant for the computation. To perform such operation in the one-way computing frame, it is possible to implement the following CME pattern:

    {\displaystyle s_{2}=s_{4}=1}
   and thus the squared Pauli operator

    {\displaystyle X^{2}}
   returns the identity.
As seen in such example, in the measurement-based computation model, the physical input qubit (the first one) and output qubit (the third one) may differ each other.

Equivalence between quantum circuit model and MBQC
The one-way quantum computer allows the implementation of a circuit of unitary transformations through the operations of entanglement and measurement. At the same time, any quantum circuit can be in turn converted into a CME pattern: a technique to translate quantum circuits into a MBQC pattern of measurements has been formulated by V. Danos et al.Such conversion can be carried on by using a universal set of logic gates composed by the 
  
    
      
        C

        (

        )

   operators: therefore, any circuit can be decomposed into a set of

   whose vertices 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   correspond to the qubits, while the edges 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   represent the entanglements between the qubits themselves. The vertices can be labelled by a 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   index, while the edges, linking the

    {\displaystyle i}

Hardware and applications
Topological cluster state quantum computer
Measurement-based computation on a periodic 3D lattice cluster  state can be used to implement topological quantum error correction. Topological cluster state computation is closely related to Kitaev's toric code, as the 3D topological cluster state can be constructed and measured over time by a repeated sequence of gates on a 2D array.

Implementations
One-way quantum computation has been demonstrated by running the 2 qubit Grover's algorithm on a 2x2 cluster state of photons.  A linear optics quantum computer based on one-way computation has been proposed.Cluster states have also been created in optical lattices, but were not used for computation as the atom qubits were too close together to measure individually.

AKLT state as a resource

  ) AKLT state on a 2D honeycomb lattice can be used as a resource for MBQC.
More recently it has been shown that a spin-mixture AKLT state can be used as a resource.
