The Turing Baronetcy, of Foveran in the County of Aberdeen, is a title in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. It was created in 1638 for John Turing, who was granted the barony of Foveran in Aberdeenshire by the king. He was a supporter of Charles I and was taken prisoner by the Covenanters in 1639. In 1651, he fought at the Battle of Worcester. The Turing family descends from Sir William Turing, a supporter of David II (1329–1371).
The cryptographer and computing pioneer Alan Turing was the uncle of the twelfth Baronet.
