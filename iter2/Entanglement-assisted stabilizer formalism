In the theory of quantum communication, the entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism is a method for protecting quantum information with the help of entanglement shared between a sender and receiver before they transmit quantum data over a quantum communication channel. It extends the standard stabilizer formalism
by including shared entanglement (Brun et al. 2006).
The advantage of entanglement-assisted stabilizer codes is that the sender can
exploit the error-correcting properties of an arbitrary set of Pauli operators.
The sender's Pauli operators do not necessarily have to form an
Abelian subgroup of the Pauli group 
  
    
      
        
          Π
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Pi ^{n}}
   over 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   qubits.
The sender can make clever use of her shared
ebits so that the global stabilizer is Abelian and thus forms a valid
quantum error-correcting code.

Definition
We review the construction of an entanglement-assisted code (Brun et al. 2006). Suppose that
there is a nonabelian subgroup 
  
    
      
        
          
            S
          
        
        ⊂
        
          Π
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}\subset \Pi ^{n}}
   of size 
  
    
      
        n
        −
        k

Application of the fundamental theorem of symplectic geometry (Lemma 1 in the first external reference)
states that there exists a minimal set of independent generators

determines that the code requires 
  
    
      
        s

   ancilla qubits and 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   ebits. The code
requires an ebit for every anticommuting pair in the minimal generating set.
The simple reason for this requirement is that an ebit is a simultaneous

  
    
      
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle +1}

  . The second qubit
in the ebit transforms the anticommuting pair 
  
    
      
        
          {
          
            X

commuting pair

          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{XX,ZZ\right\}}
  . The above decomposition also
minimizes the number of ebits required for the code---it is an optimal decomposition.

Operation
The operation of an entanglement-assisted code is as follows. The sender
performs an encoding unitary on her unprotected qubits, ancilla qubits, and
her half of the ebits. The unencoded state is a simultaneous +1-eigenstate of
the following Pauli operators:

of the shared ebits. The encoding unitary transforms the unencoded Pauli operators
to the following encoded Pauli operators:

  The sender transmits all of her qubits over the noisy quantum channel. The
receiver then possesses the transmitted qubits and his half of the ebits. He
measures the above encoded operators to diagnose the error. The last step is
to correct the error.

Rate of an entanglement-assisted code
We can interpret the rate of an entanglement-assisted code
in three different ways (Wilde and Brun 2007b).
Suppose that an entanglement-assisted quantum code encodes 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   information
qubits into 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   physical qubits with the help of 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   ebits.

The entanglement-assisted rate assumes that entanglement shared between sender and receiver is free. Bennett et al. make this assumption when deriving the entanglement assisted capacity of a quantum channel for sending quantum information. The entanglement-assisted rate is 
  
    
      
        k
        
          /
        
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle k/n}
   for a code with the above parameters.
The trade-off rate assumes that entanglement is not free and a rate pair determines performance. The first number in the pair is the number of noiseless qubits generated per channel use, and the second number in the pair is the number of ebits consumed per channel use. The rate pair is 
  
    
      
        
          (
          
            k
            
              /
            
            n
            ,
            c
            
              /
            
            n
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(k/n,c/n\right)}
   for a code with the above parameters. Quantum information theorists have computed asymptotic trade-off curves that bound the rate region in which achievable rate pairs lie. The construction for an entanglement-assisted quantum block code minimizes the number 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   of ebits given a fixed number 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   and 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   of respective information qubits and physical qubits.
The catalytic rate assumes that bits of entanglement are built up at the expense of transmitted qubits. A noiseless quantum channel or the encoded use of noisy quantum channel are two different ways to build up entanglement between a sender and receiver. The catalytic rate of an 
  
    
      
        
          [
          
            n
            ,
            k
            ;
            c
          
          ]
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left[n,k;c\right]}
   code is 
  
    
      
        
          (
          
            k
            −
            c

  .Which interpretation is most reasonable depends on the context in which we use
the code. In any case, the parameters 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  ,

    {\displaystyle k}
  , and 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   ultimately govern
performance, regardless of which definition of the rate we use to interpret
that performance.

Example of an entanglement-assisted code
We present an example of an entanglement-assisted code
that corrects an arbitrary single-qubit error (Brun et al. 2006). Suppose
the sender wants to use the quantum error-correcting properties of the
following nonabelian subgroup of 
  
    
      
        
          Π

  The first two generators anticommute. We obtain a modified third generator by
multiplying the third generator by the second. We then multiply the last
generator by the first, second, and modified third generators. The
error-correcting properties of the generators are invariant under these
operations. The modified generators are as follows:

generators:

  The receiver measures the above generators upon receipt of all qubits to
detect and correct errors.

Encoding algorithm
We continue with the previous example. We
detail an algorithm for determining an encoding circuit and the optimal number
of ebits for the entanglement-assisted code---this algorithm first appeared in the appendix of (Wilde and Brun 2007a) and later in the appendix of (Shaw et al. 2008). The operators in
the above example have the following representation as a binary
matrix (See the stabilizer code article):

The algorithm consists of row and column operations on the above matrix. Row
operations do not affect the error-correcting properties of the code but are
crucial for arriving at the optimal decomposition from the fundamental theorem
of symplectic geometry. The operations available for manipulating columns of
the above matrix are Clifford operations. Clifford
operations preserve the Pauli group

   under conjugation. The
CNOT gate, the Hadamard gate, and the Phase gate generate the Clifford group.

The algorithm begins by computing the symplectic product between the first row
and all other rows. We emphasize that the symplectic product here is the
standard symplectic product. Leave the matrix as it is if the first row is not
symplectically orthogonal to the second row or if the first row is
symplectically orthogonal to all other rows. Otherwise, swap the second row
with the first available row that is not symplectically orthogonal to the
first row. In our example, the first row is not symplectically orthogonal to
the second so we leave all rows as they are.
Arrange the first row so that the top left entry in the 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   matrix is one. A
CNOT, swap, Hadamard, or combinations of these operations can achieve this
result. We can have this result in our example by swapping qubits one and two.

  Perform CNOTs to clear the entries in the 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   matrix in the top row to the
right of the leftmost entry. These entries are already zero in this example so
we need not do anything. Proceed to the clear the entries in the first row of
the 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}
   matrix. Perform a phase gate to clear the leftmost entry in the first
row of the 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}
   matrix if it is equal to one. It is equal to zero in this case
so we need not do anything. We then use Hadamards and CNOTs to clear the other
entries in the first row of the 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}
   matrix.
We perform the above operations for our example. Perform a Hadamard on qubits
two and three. The matrix becomes

  The first two rows are now complete. They need one ebit to compensate for
their anticommutativity or their nonorthogonality with respect to the
symplectic product.
Now we perform a "Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization" with respect to the symplectic product.

rows three and four. The matrix becomes

  The first two rows are now symplectically orthogonal to all other rows per the
fundamental theorem of symplectic geometry.
We proceed with the same algorithm on the next two rows. The next two rows are
symplectically orthogonal to each other so we can deal with them individually.
Perform a Hadamard on qubit two. The matrix becomes

  The above matrix now corresponds to the canonical Pauli operators. Adding one half of an ebit to the receiver's side
gives the canonical stabilizer whose
simultaneous +1-eigenstate is the above state.
The above operations in reverse order
take the canonical stabilizer to the encoded
