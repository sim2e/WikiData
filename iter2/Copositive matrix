In mathematics, specifically linear algebra, a real matrix A is copositive if

  
    
      
        
          x
          
            T
          
        
        A
        x
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{T}Ax\geq 0}
  for every nonnegative vector 
  
    
      
        x
        ≥
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\geq 0}
  .  The collection of all copositive matrices is a proper cone; it includes as a subset the collection of real positive-definite matrices.
Copositive matrices find applications in economics, operations research, and statistics.
