The Bacon–Shor code is a subsystem error correcting code. In a subsystem code, information is encoded in a subsystem of a Hilbert space. Subsystem codes lend to simplified error correcting procedures unlike codes which encode information in the subspace of a Hilbert space.  This simplicity led to the first claim of fault tolerant circuit demonstration on a quantum computer. It is named after Dave Bacon and Peter Shor.

  . Given that the Bacon–Shor code is defined on a square lattice where the qubits are placed on the vertices; laying the qubits on a grid in a way that corresponds to the gauge group shows how only 2 qubit nearest-neighbor measurements are needed to infer the error syndromes. The simplicity of  deducing the syndromes reduces the overheard for fault tolerant error correction.
