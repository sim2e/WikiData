Peter Bruce Andrews (born 1937) is an American mathematician and Professor of Mathematics, Emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the creator of the mathematical logic Q0. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1964 under the tutelage of Alonzo Church. He received the Herbrand Award in 2003. His research group designed the TPS automated theorem prover. A subsystem ETPS (Educational Theorem Proving System) of TPS is used to help students learn logic by interactively constructing natural deduction proofs.
