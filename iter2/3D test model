This is a list of models and meshes commonly used in 3D computer graphics for testing and demonstrating rendering algorithms and visual effects. Their use is important for comparing results, similar to the way standard test images are used in image processing.

Modelled
Designed using CAD software; sorted by year of modelling.

Scanned
Includes photogrammetric methods; sorted by year of scanning.
