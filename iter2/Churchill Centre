History
The predecessor organizations were the Winston S. Churchill Study Unit (1968), a chapter of the American Topical Association, and The Churchill Centre. In 2008 The Churchill Centre merged with the American Friends of the Churchill Museum, to form The Churchill Centre and Museum at the Cabinet War Rooms, London. In 2016, with the opening of the National Churchill Library and Center in Washington, D.C., The Churchill Centre was merged into a newly formed entity once again called the International Churchill Society which combined the memberships of The Churchill Centre and the Friends of the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri.

The National Churchill Leadership Center (NCLC)
The Society partnered with the George Washington University to create a library and museum in Washington, DC. It opened on 29 October 2016.
