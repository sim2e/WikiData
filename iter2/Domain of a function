In mathematics, the domain of a function is the set of inputs accepted by the function. It is sometimes denoted by 
  
    
      
        dom
        ⁡
        (
        f
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {dom} (f)}
   or 
  
    
      
        dom
        ⁡
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {dom} f}
  , where f is the function. In layman's terms, the domain of a function can generally be thought of as "what x can be".More precisely, given a function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\colon X\to Y}
  , the domain of f is X. In modern mathematical language, the domain is part of the definition of a function rather than a property of it.
In the special case that X and Y are both sets of real numbers, the function f can be graphed in the Cartesian coordinate system. In this case, the domain is represented on the x-axis of the graph, as the projection of the graph of the function onto the x-axis.
For a function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\colon X\to Y}
  , the set Y is called the codomain, and the set of values attained by the function (which is a subset of Y) is called its range or image.
Any function can be restricted to a subset of its domain. The restriction of 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\colon X\to Y}
   to 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  , where 
  
    
      
        A
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\subseteq X}
  , is written as 
  
    
      
        
          
            
            f
            |
          
          
            A
          
        
        :
        A
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left.f\right|_{A}\colon A\to Y}
  .

Natural domain
If a real function f is given by a formula, it may be not defined for some values of the variable. In this case, it is a partial function, and the set of real numbers on which the formula can be evaluated to a real number is called the natural domain or domain of definition of f. In many contexts, a partial function is called simply a function, and its natural domain is called simply its domain.

Examples
The function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   defined by 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          
            1
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{x}}}
   cannot be evaluated at 0. Therefore, the natural domain of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is the set of real numbers excluding 0, which can be denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
        ∖
        {
        0
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \setminus \{0\}}

        :
        x
        ≠

  .

                    /
                  
                  x
                
                
                  x
                  ≠
                  0
                
              
              
                
                  0
                
                
                  x
                  =
                  0
                
              
            
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}1/x&x\not =0\\0&x=0\end{cases}},}

   for some integer

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} \setminus \{{\tfrac {\pi }{2}}+k\pi :k\in \mathbb {Z} \}}
  .

Other uses
The term domain is also commonly used in a different sense in mathematical analysis: a domain is a non-empty connected open set in a topological space. In particular, in real and complex analysis, a domain is a non-empty connected open subset of the real coordinate space 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
   or the complex coordinate space 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}.}
  
Sometimes such a domain is used as the domain of a function, although functions may be defined on more general sets. The two concepts are sometimes conflated as in, for example, the study of partial differential equations: in that case, a domain is the open connected subset of 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}}
   where a problem is posed, making it both an analysis-style domain and also the domain of the unknown function(s) sought.

Set theoretical notions
For example, it is sometimes convenient in set theory to permit the domain of a function to be a proper class X, in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple (X, Y, G). With such a definition, functions do not have a domain, although some authors still use it informally after introducing a function in the form f: X → Y.
