In mathematics, persymmetric matrix may refer to:

a square matrix which is symmetric with respect to the northeast-to-southwest diagonal (anti-diagonal); or
a square matrix such that the values on each line perpendicular to the main diagonal are the same for a given line.The first definition is the most common in the recent literature. The designation "Hankel matrix" is often used for matrices satisfying the property in the second definition.

Definition 1
Let A = (aij) be an n × n matrix.  The first definition of persymmetric requires that

            i

        =
        
          a

    {\displaystyle a_{ij}=a_{n-j+1,n-i+1}}
   for all i, j.For example, 5 × 5 persymmetric matrices are of the form

  This can be equivalently expressed as AJ = JAT where J is the exchange matrix. 
A third way to express this is seen by post-multiplyingg AJ = JAT  with J on both sides, showing that  AT rotated 180 degrees  is identical to A.   A = JATJ.
A symmetric matrix is a matrix whose values are symmetric in the northwest-to-southeast diagonal. If a symmetric matrix is rotated by 90°, it becomes a persymmetric matrix.  Symmetric persymmetric matrices are sometimes called bisymmetric matrices.

Definition 2
The second definition is due to Thomas Muir. It says that the square matrix A = (aij) is persymmetric if aij depends only on i + j. Persymmetric matrices in this sense, or Hankel matrices as they are often called, are of the form
