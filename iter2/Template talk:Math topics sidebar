Right, can someone explain what business "meta" links such as the RecentChanges ones have being present on an article-space template? These are of no use to normal readers and fail what I think is the reasonable litmus test of making sense on a print version of Wikipedia. --Cybercobra (talk) 07:35, 2 September 2009 (UTC)

I think I found a compromise. See Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics#.22Recent_changes.22_links_removed_from_MathTopicTOC. Pcap ping 14:15, 2 September 2009 (UTC)
The global change from "List" to "Index" is supported by the consensus of exactly 2 editors, without significant opposition (until possibly now).  However, it should not have been done without consulting the WikiProject so that the bots could be rewritten, even if there were consensus for the move.  I think the remaining problems are resolved by the compromise suggested by Pcap.  â€” Arthur Rubin  (talk) 14:28, 2 September 2009 (UTC)
