Some Wikipedians have formed a project to better organize information in articles related to chemistry. This page and its subpages contain their suggestions; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians. If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page and see the to-do list there. The Chemistry portal is maintained at Portal:Chemistry and the project banner is {{WikiProject Chemistry}}. We also have a structure drawing workgroup and a Gold Book workgroup. Chemistry articles considered of vital importance to Wikipedia are listed on the expanded vital articles list.

This Wikiproject strives to incorporate the collaborative efforts of those with interests within chemistry and related areas into the articles and therefore the overall quality of the Wikipedia. In order to maintain a high-level of scientific and encyclopedic articles, and as members of this wikiproject, and even Wikipedia itself, we have a duty to provide accurate verifiable information.
We allow anyone to participate within the wikiproject, collaborate, edit and participate in our article development drives, under the following conditions;

When new information is added, try to find at least one reference of where you got it from.
When you're adding new information...
Make sure it's not already in the article or Wikipedia.
Make sure that you verify it yourself with at least ONE other source before adding.
Verify ALL formulae before adding.

Goals
The overall goals of this project are to coordinate activities relating to chemistry, and to improve the quality of chemistry-related articles. 
Based on initial comments from project participants, the following SMART goals are proposed for the project (December 5th 2005). All articles will be assessed for their quality and completeness, and this will be tracked on the worklist. Please leave comments in the goals discussion on the talk page.

Write a full page for each of the major sub-disciplines within chemistry.
Write a full page for 30 important concepts such as solution, from a variety of areas of chemistry.
Write a full page for a selection of 40 "giants of chemistry" such as Antoine Lavoisier, covering all history. 15 of these should be historical figures from early history up to the 18th century, while another 15 should have been active during the 19th century. The last 10 should be from the 20th and 21st century.
Write a full page for 10 major classes of chemical reactions such as nucleophilic substitution.
Write a full page for 10 important chemical processes used in industry, e.g. Contact process.
Write 20 complete articles on common laboratory techniques (e.g., filtration) and analytical techniques.
Write a full article covering the 12 major organic functional groups using the class name, such as aldehyde.
Write a full article for 12 ions, including the ammonium ion and 11 major anions such as chloride.
Write a full article for 10 major topics in physical chemistry,principally in chemical kinetics and chemical thermodynamics.
