Wikipedia articles that use mm dd yyyy date formats, whether by application of the first main contributor rule or by virtue of close national ties to the subject, belong in this category. Use {{Use mdy dates}} to add an article to this category. See MOS:NUM.
This system of tagging or categorisation is used as a status monitor of all articles that use mm dd yyyy date formats, and not as a clean up.
After being tagged, usually manually, and bearing in mind article evolution, a bot can be sent around to clean up formatting after, say, 12 months have elapsed. The bot would correct any new introductions since its last visit, and would also put or update the visit date on the {{Use mdy dates}} template.
