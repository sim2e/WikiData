VectorBase is one of the five Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRC) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. VectorBase is  focused on invertebrate vectors of human pathogens working with the sequencing centers and the research community to curate vector genomes (mainly genome annotation).
