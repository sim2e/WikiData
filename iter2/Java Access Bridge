The Java Access Bridge (JAB) exposes accessibility information about Java components to screen readers and other assistive technologies running on the Windows platform.
Prior to Java SE Version 7 Update 6, the Java Access Bridge needed to be installed separately, but is now distributed with the Java Runtime Environment.
