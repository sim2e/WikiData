In linear algebra, a minor of a matrix A is the determinant of some smaller square matrix, cut down from A by removing one or more of its rows and columns. Minors obtained by removing just one row and one column from square matrices (first minors) are required for calculating matrix cofactors, which in turn are useful for computing both the determinant and inverse of square matrices.  The requirement that the square matrix be smaller than the original matrix is often omitted in the definition.

Definition and illustration
First minors
If A is a square matrix, then the minor of the entry in the i th row and j th column (also called the (i, j) minor, or a first minor) is the determinant of the submatrix formed by deleting the i th row and j th column. This number is often denoted Mi,j. The (i, j) cofactor is obtained by multiplying the minor by 
  
    
      
        (
        −
        1
        
          )
          
            i
            +
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (-1)^{i+j}}
  .
To illustrate these definitions, consider the following 3 by 3 matrix,

  
    
      
        
          
            [

    {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}1&4&7\\3&0&5\\-1&9&11\\\end{bmatrix}}}
  To compute the minor M2,3 and the cofactor C2,3, we find the determinant of the above matrix with row 2 and column 3 removed.

General definition
Let A be an m × n matrix and k an integer with 0 < k ≤ m, and k ≤ n. A k × k minor of A, also called minor determinant of order k of A or, if m = n, (n−k)th minor determinant of A (the word "determinant" is often omitted, and the word "degree" is sometimes used instead of "order") is the determinant of a k × k matrix obtained from A by deleting m−k rows and n−k columns. Sometimes the term is used to refer to the k × k matrix obtained from A as above (by deleting m−k rows and n−k columns), but this matrix should be referred to as a (square) submatrix of A, leaving the term "minor" to refer to the determinant of this matrix. For a matrix A as above, there are a total of

   is standard everywhere in the literature and is used in this article also.

Complement
The complement, Bijk...,pqr..., of a minor, Mijk...,pqr..., of a square matrix, A, is formed by the determinant of the matrix A from which all the rows (ijk...) and columns (pqr...) associated with Mijk...,pqr... have been removed.  The complement of the first minor of an element aij is merely that element.

Applications of minors and cofactors
Cofactor expansion of the determinant
The cofactors feature prominently in Laplace's formula for the expansion of determinants, which is a method of computing larger determinants in terms of smaller ones. Given an n × n matrix 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        (
        
          a
          
            i
            j
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle A=(a_{ij})}
  , the determinant of A, denoted det(A), can be written as the sum of the cofactors of any row or column of the matrix multiplied by the entries that generated them. In other words, defining

Inverse of a matrix
One can write down the inverse of an invertible matrix by computing its cofactors by using Cramer's rule, as follows. The matrix formed by all of the cofactors of a square matrix A is called the cofactor matrix (also called the matrix of cofactors or, sometimes, comatrix):

  Then the inverse of A is the transpose of the cofactor matrix times the reciprocal of the determinant of A:

  
    
      
        
          
            A

              )

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} ^{-1}={\frac {1}{\operatorname {det} (\mathbf {A} )}}\mathbf {C} ^{\mathsf {T}}.}
  The transpose of the cofactor matrix is called the adjugate matrix (also called the classical adjoint) of A.

Other applications
Given an m × n matrix with real entries (or entries from any other field) and rank r, then there exists at least one non-zero r × r minor, while all larger minors are zero.
We will use the following notation for minors: if A is an m × n matrix, I is a subset of {1,...,m} with k elements, and J is a subset of {1,...,n} with k elements, then we write [A]I,J for the k × k minor of A that corresponds to the rows with index in I and the columns with index in J.

If I = J, then [A]I,J is called a principal minor.
If the matrix that corresponds to a principal minor is a square upper-left submatrix of the larger matrix (i.e., it consists of matrix elements in rows and columns from 1 to k, also known as a leading principal submatrix), then the principal minor is called a leading principal minor (of order k) or corner (principal) minor (of order k). For an n × n square matrix, there are n leading principal minors.
A basic minor of a matrix is the determinant of a square submatrix that is of maximal size with nonzero determinant.
For Hermitian matrices, the leading principal minors can be used to test for positive definiteness and the principal minors can be used to test for positive semidefiniteness. See Sylvester's criterion for more details.Both the formula for ordinary matrix multiplication and the Cauchy–Binet formula for the determinant of the product of two matrices are special cases of the following general statement about the minors of a product of two matrices.
Suppose that A is an m × n matrix, B is an n × p matrix, I is a subset of {1,...,m} with k elements and J is a subset of {1,...,p} with k elements. Then

  
    
      
        [
        
          A
          B

            I
            ,
            J
          
        
        =
        
          ∑
          
            K
          
        
        [
        
          A
        
        
          ]
          
            I
            ,
            K
          
        
        [
        
          B
        
        
          ]
          
            K
            ,
            J
          
        
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle [\mathbf {AB} ]_{I,J}=\sum _{K}[\mathbf {A} ]_{I,K}[\mathbf {B} ]_{K,J}\,}
  where the sum extends over all subsets K of {1,...,n} with k elements. This formula is a straightforward extension of the Cauchy–Binet formula.

Multilinear algebra approach
A more systematic, algebraic treatment of minors is given in multilinear algebra, using the wedge product: the k-minors of a matrix are the entries in the kth exterior power map.
If the columns of a matrix are wedged together k at a time, the k × k minors appear as the components of the resulting k-vectors. For example, the 2 × 2 minors of the matrix

  
    
      
        
          
            (

                  3
                
                
                  
                  
                  −
                  1

    {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&4\\3&\!\!-1\\2&1\\\end{pmatrix}}}
  are −13 (from the first two rows), −7 (from the first and last row), and 5 (from the last two rows). Now consider the wedge product

A remark about different notation
In some books, instead of cofactor the term adjunct is used. Moreover, it is denoted as Aij and defined in the same way as cofactor:

  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
          
            i
            j
          
        
        =
        (
        −
        1
        
          )
          
            i
            +
            j
          
        
        
          
            M
          
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{ij}=(-1)^{i+j}\mathbf {M} _{ij}}
  Using this notation the inverse matrix is written this way:

  
    
      
        
          
            M

            1
            
              det

  Keep in mind that adjunct is not adjugate or adjoint. In modern terminology, the "adjoint" of a matrix most often refers to the corresponding  adjoint operator.
