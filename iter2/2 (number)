2 (two) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number following 1 and preceding 3. It is the smallest and only even prime number. Because it forms the basis of a duality, it has religious and spiritual significance in many cultures.

Evolution
Arabic digit
The digit used in the modern Western world to represent the number 2 traces its roots back to the Indic Brahmic script, where "2" was written as two horizontal lines. The modern Chinese and Japanese languages (and Korean Hanja) still use this method. The Gupta script rotated the two lines 45 degrees, making them diagonal. The top line was sometimes also shortened and had its bottom end curve towards the center of the bottom line. In the Nagari script, the top line was written more like a curve connecting to the bottom line. In the Arabic Ghubar writing, the bottom line was completely vertical, and the digit looked like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring the bottom line to its original horizontal position, but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to the bottom line leads to our modern digit.In fonts with text figures, digit 2 usually is of x-height, for example, .

As a word
Two is most commonly a determiner used with plural countable nouns, as in two days or I'll take these two. Two is a noun when it refers to the number two as in two plus two is four.

Etymology of two
The word two is derived from the Old English words twā (feminine), tū (neuter), and twēġen (masculine, which survives today in the form twain).The pronunciation /tuː/, like that of who is due to the labialization of the vowel by the w, which then disappeared before the related sound. The successive stages of pronunciation for the Old English twā would thus be /twɑː/, /twɔː/, /twoː/, /twuː/, and finally /tuː/.

In mathematics
Two is the smallest, and the only even prime number. As the smallest prime number, it is also the smallest non-zero pronic number, and the only pronic prime. The next prime is three, which makes two and three the only two consecutive prime numbers. Two is the first prime number that does not have a proper twin prime with a difference two, while three is the first such prime number to have a twin prime, five. In consequence, three and five encase four in-between, which is the square of two or

            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{2}}
  . These are also the two odd prime numbers that lie amongst the only all-Harshad numbers 1, 2, 4, and 6.
An integer is called even if it is divisible by 2. For integers written in a numeral system based on an even number such as decimal, divisibility by 2 is easily tested by merely looking at the last digit. If it is even, then the whole number is even. In particular, when written in the decimal system, all multiples of 2 will end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.Two is the base of the binary system, the numeral system with the fewest tokens that allows denoting a natural number substantially more concisely (with 
  
    
      
        
          log
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \log _{2}}

    {\displaystyle n}
   tokens) than a direct representation by the corresponding count of a single token (with 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   tokens). This binary number system is used extensively in computing.
The square root of 2 was the first known irrational number. Taking the square root of a number is such a common and essential mathematical operation, that the spot on the root sign where the index would normally be written for cubic and other roots, may simply be left blank for square roots, as it is tacitly understood.
Powers of two are central to the concept of Mersenne primes, and important to computer science. Two is the first Mersenne prime exponent. They are also essential to Fermat primes and Pierpont primes, which have consequences in the constructability of regular polygons using basic tools.
In a set-theoretical construction of the natural numbers, two is identified with the set 
  
    
      
        {
        {
        ∅
        }
        ,
        ∅
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\{\varnothing \},\varnothing \}}
  . This latter set is important in category theory: it is a subobject classifier in the category of sets. A set that is a field has a minimum of two elements.
A Cantor space is a topological space

        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0,1\}}
  , is the traditional elementary example of a Cantor space.  
A number is deficient when the sum of its divisors is less than twice the number, whereas an abundant number has a sum of its proper divisors that is larger than the number itself. Primitive abundant numbers are abundant numbers whose proper divisors are all deficient.
A number is perfect if it is equal to its aliquot sum, or the sum of all of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. This is equivalent to describing a perfect number 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   as having a sum of divisors
