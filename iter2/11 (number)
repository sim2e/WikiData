11 (eleven) is the natural number following 10 and preceding 12. It is the first repdigit. In English, it is the smallest positive integer whose name has three syllables.

Name
"Eleven" derives from the Old English ęndleofon, which is first attested in Bede's late 9th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People. It has cognates in every Germanic language (for example, German elf), whose Proto-Germanic ancestor has been reconstructed as *ainalifa-, from the prefix *aina- (adjectival "one") and suffix *-lifa-, of uncertain meaning. It is sometimes compared with the Lithuanian vienúolika, though -lika is used as the suffix for all numbers from 11 to 19 (analogously to "-teen").The Old English form has closer cognates in Old Frisian, Saxon, and Norse, whose ancestor has been reconstructed as *ainlifun. This was formerly thought to be derived from Proto-Germanic *tehun ("ten"); it is now sometimes connected with *leikʷ- or *leip- ("left; remaining"), with the implicit meaning that "one is left" after counting to ten.

In languages
While 11 has its own name in Germanic languages such as English, German, or Swedish, and some Latin-based languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and French, it is the first compound number in many other languages: Chinese 十一 shí yī, Korean 열하나 yeol hana or 십일 ship il.

In mathematics
Eleven is the fifth prime number, and the first two-digit numeric palindrome in decimal. It forms a twin prime with 13, and it is the first member of the second prime quadruplet (11, 13, 17, 19). 11 is the first prime exponent that does not yield a Mersenne prime, where

  , which is composite. On the other hand, the eleventh prime number 31 is the third Mersenne prime, while the thirty-first prime number 127 is not only a Mersenne prime but also the second double Mersenne prime. 11 is also the fifth Heegner number, meaning that the ring of integers of the field

   in decimal (and simply, the first repunit), as well as the second unique prime in base ten. It is the first strong prime, the second good prime, the third super-prime, the fourth Lucas prime, and the fifth consecutive supersingular prime.The rows of Pascal's triangle can be seen as representation of the powers of 11.11 of 35 hexominoes can fold in a net to form a cube, while 11 of 66 octiamonds can fold into a regular octahedron.

An 11-sided polygon is called a hendecagon, or undecagon. The complete graph

   has a total of 55 edges, which collectively represent the diagonals and sides of a hendecagon. 
A regular hendecagon cannot be constructed with a compass and straightedge alone, as 11 is not a product of distinct Fermat primes, and it is also the first polygon that is not able to be constructed with the aid of an angle trisector.11 and some of its multiples appear as counts of uniform tessellations in various dimensions and spaces; there are:

11 regular and semiregular convex uniform tilings in the Euclidean plane, which are dual to the 11 Laves tilings.22 edge-to-edge uniform tilings with convex and star polygons, and 33 uniform tilings with zizgzag apeirogons that alternate between two angles.11 regular complex apeirogons, which are tilings with polygons that have a countably infinite number of sides. 8 solutions of the form p{q}r satisfy δp,r2 in

In decimal
11 is the smallest two-digit prime number. On the seven-segment display of a calculator, it is both a strobogrammatic prime and a dihedral prime.Multiples of 11 by one-digit numbers yield palindromic numbers with matching double digits: 00, 11, 22, 33, 44, etc.
The sum of the first 11 non-zero positive integers, equivalently the 11th triangular number, is 66. On the other hand, the sum of the first 11 integers, from zero to ten, is 55.
The first four powers of 11 yield palindromic numbers: 111 = 11, 112 = 121, 113 = 1331, and 114 = 14641.
11 is the 11th index or member in the sequence of palindromic numbers, and 121, equal to

  ), which is about 0.8% less than 10149.If a number is divisible by 11, reversing its digits will result in another multiple of 11. As long as no two adjacent digits of a number added together exceed 9, then multiplying the number by 11, reversing the digits of the product, and dividing that new number by 11 will yield a number that is the reverse of the original number; as in:

142,312 × 11 = 1,565,432 → 2,345,651 ÷ 11 = 213,241.

Divisibility tests
A simple test to determine whether an integer is divisible by 11 is to take every digit of the number in an odd position and add them, then take the remaining digits and add them. If the difference between the two sums is a multiple of 11, including 0, then the number is divisible by 11. For instance, with the number 65,637:

This technique also works with groups of digits rather than individual digits, so long as the number of digits in each group is odd, although not all groups have to have the same number of digits. If one uses three digits in each group, one gets from 65,637 the calculation,

Another test for divisibility is to separate a number into groups of two consecutive digits (adding a leading zero if there is an odd number of digits), and then add the numbers so formed; if the result is divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11:

This also works by adding a trailing zero instead of a leading one, and with larger groups of digits, provided that each group has an even number of digits (not all groups have to have the same number of digits):

Multiplying 11
An easy way to multiply numbers by 11 in base 10 is: 
If the number has:

1 digit, replicate the digit: 2 × 11 becomes 22.
2 digits, add the 2 digits and place the result in the middle: 47 × 11 becomes 4 (11) 7 or 4 (10+1) 7 or (4+1) 1 7 or 517.
3 digits, keep the first digit in its place for the result's first digit, add the first and second digits to form the result's second digit, add the second and third digits to form the result's third digit, and keep the third digit as the result's fourth digit. For any resulting numbers greater than 9, carry the 1 to the left.  123 × 11 becomes 1 (1+2) (2+3) 3 or 1353.  481 × 11 becomes 4 (4+8) (8+1) 1 or 4 (10+2) 9 1 or (4+1) 2 9 1 or 5291.
4 or more digits, follow the same pattern as for 3 digits.
