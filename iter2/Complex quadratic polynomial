A complex quadratic polynomial is a quadratic polynomial whose coefficients and variable are complex numbers.

Properties
Quadratic polynomials have the following properties, regardless of the form:

It is a unicritical polynomial, i.e. it has one finite critical point in the complex plane, Dynamical plane consist of maximally 2 basins: basin of infinity and basin of finite critical point ( if finite critical point do not escapes)
It can be postcritically finite, i.e. the orbit of the critical point can be finite, because the critical point is periodic or preperiodic.
It is a unimodal function,
It is a rational function,
It is an entire function.

Forms
When the quadratic polynomial has only one variable (univariate), one can distinguish its four main forms:

The general form: 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        =
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        
          x

        +
        
          a
          
            1
          
        
        x
        +
        
          a
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)=a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}}
   where 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            2
          
        
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{2}\neq 0}

Critical level curves
A critical level curve the level curve which contain critical point. It acts as a sort of skeleton of dynamical plane
Example : level curves cross at saddle point, which is a special type of critical point.

Critical limit set
Critical limit set is the set of forward orbit of all critical points

Critical orbit
The forward orbit of a critical point is called a critical orbit. Critical orbits are very important because every attracting periodic orbit attracts a critical point, so studying the critical orbits helps us understand the dynamics in the Fatou set.

Critical curves
Diagrams of critical polynomials are called critical curves.These curves create the skeleton (the dark lines) of a bifurcation diagram.

Spaces, planes
4D space
One can use the Julia-Mandelbrot 4-dimensional (4D) space for a global analysis of this dynamical system.
In this space there are two basic types of 2D planes:

the dynamical (dynamic) plane, 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{c}}
  -plane or  c-plane
the parameter plane or z-planeThere is also another plane used to analyze such dynamical systems  w-plane: 

the conjugation plane
model plane

2D Parameter plane

The phase space of a quadratic map is called its parameter plane. Here:

  
    
      
        
          z
          
            0
          
        
        =
        
          z
          
            c
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{0}=z_{cr}}
   is constant and 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is variable.
There is no dynamics here. It is only a set of parameter values. There are no orbits on the parameter plane.
The parameter plane consists of:

The Mandelbrot set
The bifurcation locus = boundary of Mandelbrot set with
root points
Bounded hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set = interior of Mandelbrot set with internal rays
exterior of Mandelbrot set with
external rays
equipotential linesThere are many different subtypes of the parameter plane.

2D Dynamical plane
"The polynomial Pc maps each dynamical ray to another ray doubling the angle (which we measure in full turns, i.e. 0 = 1 = 2π rad = 360°), and the dynamical rays of any polynomial "look like straight rays" near infinity. This allows us to study the Mandelbrot and Julia sets combinatorially, replacing the dynamical plane by the unit circle, rays by angles, and the quadratic polynomial by the doubling modulo one map." Virpi KaukoOn the dynamical plane one can find:
The Julia set
The Filled Julia set
The Fatou set
OrbitsThe dynamical plane consists of:

Fatou set
Julia setHere, 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   is a constant and

    {\displaystyle z}
   is a variable.
The two-dimensional dynamical plane can be treated as a Poincaré cross-section of three-dimensional space of continuous dynamical system.Dynamical z-planes can be divided into two groups:

  
    
      
        
          f
