These professors have gained credible knowledge from working in, and doing research on nonprofit organizations. Other professors in nonprofit studies tend to also be a part of sociology, psychology, or public administration departments.
Curriculum in nonprofit studies programs vary from program to program with a heavy emphasis in management above other content areas mentioned above. 
In many nonprofit studies programs, experiential learning opportunities complement classroom learning. Students may take part in internships or co-operative education placements where they learn by working alongside staff in a nonprofit workplace. Community-based learning activities such as service-learning, community-based research, volunteering, and participatory action research can enhance the learning process by combining experiential learning and skill building with critical reflection on self and social/environment injustice.
