In mathematical logic, a ground term of a formal system is a term that does not contain any variables. Similarly, a ground formula is a formula that does not contain any variables.
In first-order logic with identity with constant symbols 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
  , the sentence 
  
    
      
        Q
        (
        a
        )
        ∨
        P
        (
        b
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle Q(a)\lor P(b)}
   is a ground formula. A ground expression is a ground term or ground formula.

Formal definitions
What follows is a formal definition for first-order languages. Let a first-order language be given, with 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   the set of constant symbols, 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   the set of functional operators, and 
  
    
      
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle P}
   the set of predicate symbols.

Ground term
A ground term is a term that contains no variables. Ground terms may be defined by logical recursion (formula-recursion):

Elements of 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   are ground terms;
If 
  
    
      
        f
        ∈
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\in F}
   is an 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -ary function symbol and 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          α
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          α
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}}
   are ground terms, then 
  
    
      
        f
        
          (
          
            
              α
              
                1
              
            
            ,
            
              α
              
                2
              
            
            ,
            …
            ,
            
              α
              
                n
              
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\left(\alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}\right)}
   is a ground term.
Every ground term can be given by a finite application of the above two rules (there are no other ground terms; in particular, predicates cannot be ground terms).Roughly speaking, the Herbrand universe is the set of all ground terms.

Ground atom
A ground predicate, ground atom or ground literal is an atomic formula all of whose argument terms are ground terms.
If 
  
    
      
        p
        ∈
        P
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\in P}
   is an 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  -ary predicate symbol and 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          α
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          α
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}}
   are ground terms, then 
  
    
      
        p
        
          (
          
            
              α
              
                1
              
            
            ,
            
              α
              
                2
              
            
            ,
            …
            ,
            
              α
              
                n
              
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\left(\alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}\right)}
   is a ground predicate or ground atom.
Roughly speaking, the Herbrand base is the set of all ground atoms, while a Herbrand interpretation assigns a truth value to each ground atom in the base.

Ground formula
A ground formula or ground clause is a formula without variables.
Ground formulas may be defined by syntactic recursion as follows:

A ground atom is a ground formula.
If 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
   and 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
   are ground formulas, then 
  
    
      
        ¬
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lnot \varphi }
  , 
  
    
      
        φ
        ∨
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi \lor \psi }
  , and 
  
    
      
        φ
        ∧
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi \land \psi }
   are ground formulas.Ground formulas are a particular kind of closed formulas.
