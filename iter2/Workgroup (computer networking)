In computer networking a work group is collection of computers connected on a LAN that share the common resources and responsibilities. Workgroup is Microsoft's term for a peer-to-peer local area network. Computers running Microsoft operating systems in the same work group may share files, printers, or Internet connection. Work group contrasts with a domain, in which computers rely on centralized authentication.
