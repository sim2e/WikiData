Dan Boneh (; Hebrew: דן בונה) is an Israeli–American professor in applied cryptography and computer security at Stanford University.
In 2016, Boneh was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to the theory and practice of cryptography and computer security.

Biography
Born in Israel in 1969, Boneh obtained his Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University in 1996 under the supervision of Richard J. Lipton.Boneh is one of the principal contributors to the development of pairing-based cryptography, along with Matt Franklin of the University of California, Davis. He joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1997, and became professor of computer science and electrical engineering. He teaches massive open online courses on the online learning platform Coursera. In 1999, he was awarded a fellowship from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. In 2002, he co-founded a company called Voltage Security with three of his students. The company was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2015.In 2018, Boneh became co-director (with David Mazières) of the newly founded Center for Blockchain Research at Stanford, predicting at the time that "Blockchains will become increasingly critical to doing business globally." Dr. Boneh is also known for putting his entire introductory cryptography course online for free. The course is also available via Coursera.
