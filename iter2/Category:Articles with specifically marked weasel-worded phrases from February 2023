This category combines all articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from February 2023 (2023-02) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of Category:Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases.

Articles are automatically put into this monthly category by inline templates such as {{weasel inline}}, {{by whom}}, {{who}}, and {{which}}, which mark specific words as "weasel words". (Do not add this category directly.)
The key to improving weasel words in articles is either a) to name a source for the opinion or b) to change opinionated language to concrete facts. After you have made any necessary edits, remove the template.
