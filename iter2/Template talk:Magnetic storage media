I started Template:Data storage with the idea of bringing together data storage topics, but in it's present form the template is far too narrow. It tackles only some non-volatile computer storage. Would there be interest in combining this template and Template:Data storage into something broader and more comprehensive? Moreati (talk) 13:05, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

At this point, I think this template is better separate.  Some of the topics are not strictly computer related.  -- Austin Murphy (talk) 17:04, 18 November 2008 (UTC)
