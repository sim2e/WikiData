Thai animation (Thai: แอนิเมชันไทย) has a rich history, dating back to the 1950s with the production of the first Thai animated shorts. Payut Ngaokrachang is considered the founding father of Thai animation. Over the decades, the industry has flourished, earning both local and international recognition. Today, Thailand has established itself as a popular outsourcing destination for animation work, with 91% of its animation studios providing services to international companies. This has boosted exports and raised the profile of Thai animation, earning recognition from the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) as the top animation-related business destination in Southeast Asia in 2016.

History
Early beginnings
Thai animation has a rich history dating back to the mid-20th century. The first Thai animated shorts were created using traditional hand-drawn animation techniques, with "Amazing Incidents" premiering in 1955 at the Sala Chaloem Thai. This animation, which had a runtime of 10 minutes, caught the attention of the American News Agency (USIS) in Bangkok where Payut Ngaokrachang was working as an art officer. Payut Ngaokrachang, considered a pioneer of Thai animation and a prominent animator and illustrator, was then invited to visit Toho in Japan to receive training in making animated films. He went on to create "The New Adventures of Hanuman" in 1957, which had a runtime of 14.43 minutes, and "The Children and the Bear" in 1959, which was 14 minutes long. These two animations were created while Payut was working on animation in Japan for the American News Agency, according to the agency's objective of creating an animated film against communism.In 1979, Payut Ngaokrachang created his first full-length animated film "The Adventure of Sudsakorn", which was based on the story of the poet Sunthon Phu and had a runtime of 82 minutes, consisting of 66,000 paintings. The film is widely considered a significant milestone in Thai animation history, and it was the first feature-length animated film produced in Thailand using traditional hand-drawn animation techniques. The film was a huge success, earning 2 million baht at the Athens Ratchathewi theater and making a significant impact on the Thai animation industry
