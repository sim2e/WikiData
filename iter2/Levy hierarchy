In set theory and mathematical logic, the Lévy hierarchy, introduced by Azriel Lévy in 1965, is a hierarchy of formulas in the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, which is typically called just the language of set theory. This is analogous to the arithmetical hierarchy, which provides a similar classification for sentences of the language of arithmetic.

Definitions
In the language of set theory, atomic formulas are of the form x = y or x ∈ y, standing for equality and set membership predicates, respectively.
The first level of the Lévy hierarchy is defined as containing only formulas with no unbounded quantifiers and is denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          Δ
          
            0
          
        
        =
        
          Σ

    {\displaystyle \Delta _{0}=\Sigma _{0}=\Pi _{0}}
  . The next levels are given by finding a formula in prenex normal form which is provably equivalent over ZFC, and counting the number of changes of quantifiers:p. 184A formula

  .As a formula might have several different equivalent formulas in prenex normal form, it might belong to several different levels of the hierarchy. In this case, the lowest possible level is the level of the formula.Lévy's original notation was
