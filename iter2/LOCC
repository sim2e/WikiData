LOCC, or local operations and classical communication, is a method in quantum information theory where a local (product) operation is performed on part of the system, and where the result of that operation is "communicated" classically to another part where usually another local operation is performed conditioned on the information received.

Mathematical properties
The formal definition of the set of LOCC operations is complicated due to the fact that later local operations depend in general on all the previous classical communication and due to the unbounded number of communication rounds. For any finite number 
  
    
      
        r
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle r\geq 1}
   one can define 
  
    
      
        
          LOCC
          
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {LOCC} _{r}}
  , the set of LOCC operations that can be achieved with 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
   rounds of classical communication. The set becomes strictly larger whenever 
  
    
      
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle r}
   is increased and care has to be taken to define the limit of infinitely many rounds. In particular, the set LOCC is not topologically closed, that is there are quantum operations that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by LOCC but that are not themselves LOCC.A one-round LOCC

  i.e., there are examples that cannot be implemented locally even with infinite rounds of communication.LOCC are the "free operations" in the resource theories of entanglement: Entanglement cannot be produced from separable states with LOCC and if the local parties in addition to being able to perform all LOCC operations are also furnished with some entangled states, they can realize more operations than with LOCC alone.

Examples
LOCC operations are useful for state preparation, state discrimination, and entanglement transformations.

  Let's say the two-qubit system is separated, where the first qubit is given to Alice and the second is given to Bob. Without communication, Alice and Bob cannot distinguish the two states, since for all local measurements all measurement statistics are exactly the same (both states have the same reduced density matrix). E.g., assume that Alice measures the first qubit, and obtains the result 0. Since this result is equally likely to occur (with probability 50%) in each of the two cases, she does not gain any information on which Bell pair she was given and the same holds for Bob if he performs any measurement. But now let Alice send her result to Bob over a classical channel. Now Bob can compare his result to hers and if they are the same he can conclude that the pair given was

        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi _{1}\rangle }
  , since only this allows for a joint measurement outcome

        0

    {\displaystyle |0\rangle _{A}\otimes |0\rangle _{B}}
  . Thus with LOCC and two measurements these two states can be distinguished perfectly. Note that with global (nonlocal or entangled) measurements, a single measurement (on the joint Hilbert space) is sufficient to distinguish these two (mutually orthogonal) states.
There are quantum states that cannot be distinguished with LOCC operations.

Entanglement transformations
While LOCC cannot generate entangled states out of product states, they can be used to transform entangled states into other entangled states. The restriction to LOCC severely limits which transformations are possible.

Entanglement conversion
Nielsen  has derived a general condition to determine whether one pure state of a bipartite quantum system may be transformed into another using only LOCC. Full details may be found in the paper referenced earlier, the results are sketched out here.

   have the same amount of entanglement but converting one into the other is not possible and even that conversion in either direction is impossible because neither set of Schmidt coefficients majorises the other. For large 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
   if all Schmidt coefficients are non-zero then the probability of one set of coefficients majorising the other becomes negligible. Therefore, for large 
  
    
      
        d
      
    
    {\displaystyle d}
   the probability of any arbitrary  state being convertible into another via LOCC becomes negligible.
The operations described so far are deterministic, i.e., they succeed with probability 100%. If one is satisfied by probabilistic transformations, many more transformations are possible using LOCC. These operations are called stochastic LOCC (SLOCC). In particular for multi-partite states the convertibility under SLOCC is studied to gain a qualitative insight into the entanglement properties of the involved states.

Going beyond LOCC: Catalytic conversion
If entangled states are available as a resource, these together with LOCC allow a much larger class of transformations. This is the case even if these resource states are not consumed in the process (as they are, for example, in quantum teleportation). Thus transformations are called entanglement catalysis. In this procedure, the conversion of an initial state to a final state that is impossible with LOCC is made possible by taking a tensor product of the initial state with a "catalyst state"

        c
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |c\rangle }
   and requiring that this state is still available at the end of the conversion process. I.e., the catalyst state is left unchanged by the conversion and can then be removed, leaving only the desired final state. Consider the states,

  Similarly, we make up the table:

The color in the 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   direction are all green or white, therefore, according to the Nielsen's theorem, 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
        
          |
        
        c
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle |c\rangle }
   is possible to be converted into 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ϕ
        ⟩
        
          |
        
        c
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\phi \rangle |c\rangle }
   by the LOCC. The catalyst state 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        c
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |c\rangle }
   is taken away after the conversion. Finally we find 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
        
          
            →
            
              
                |
              
              c
              ⟩
            
          
        
        
          |
        
        ϕ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle {\overset {|c\rangle }{\rightarrow }}|\phi \rangle }
   by the LOCC.
If correlations between the system and the catalyst are allowed, catalytic transformations between bipartite pure states are characterized via the entanglement entropy. In more detail, a pure state 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
   can be converted into another pure state 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ϕ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\phi \rangle }
   via catalytic LOCC if and only if 

  
    
      
        S
        (
        
          ψ
          
            A
          
        
        )
        ≥
        S
        (
        
          ϕ
          
            A
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S(\psi ^{A})\geq S(\phi ^{A})}
  ,
where 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is the von Neumann entropy, and 
  
    
      
        
          ψ
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi ^{A}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          ϕ
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \phi ^{A}}
   are the reduced states of 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
   and 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ϕ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\phi \rangle }
  , respectively. In general, the conversion is not exact, but can be performed with an arbitrary accuracy. The amount of correlations between the system and the catalyst can also be made arbitrarily small.
