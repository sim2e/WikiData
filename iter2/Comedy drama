Comedy drama, also known as the portmanteau dramedy, is a genre of dramatic works that combines elements of comedy and drama. The modern, scripted television examples tend to have more humorous bits than simple comic relief seen in a typical hour-long legal or medical drama but exhibit far fewer jokes per minute as in a typical half-hour sitcom.

In the United States
Examples from United States television include: M*A*S*H, Moonlighting, The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd, Northern Exposure, Ally McBeal, Sex and the City, Desperate Housewives, and Scrubs. The term "dramedy" was coined to describe the late 1980s wave of shows, including The Wonder Years, Hooperman, Doogie Howser, M.D., and Frank's Place.

In Indonesia
Examples from Indonesian television in the month of Ramadan 2023 include: Para Pencari Tuhan Jilid 16.
