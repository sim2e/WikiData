In mathematical logic, a conservative extension is a supertheory of a theory which is often convenient for proving theorems, but proves no new theorems about the language of the original theory. Similarly, a non-conservative extension is a supertheory which is not conservative, and can prove more theorems than the original.
More formally stated, a theory 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
   is a (proof theoretic) conservative extension of a theory 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   if every theorem of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   is a theorem of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
  , and any theorem of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
   in the language of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   is already a theorem of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
  .
More generally, if 
  
    
      
        Γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma }
   is a set of formulas in the common language of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
  , then 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
   is 
  
    
      
        Γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma }
  -conservative over 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   if every formula from 
  
    
      
        Γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma }
   provable in 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
   is also provable in 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
  .
Note that a conservative extension of a consistent theory is consistent. If it were not, then by the principle of explosion, every formula in the language of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
   would be a theorem of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
  , so every formula in the language of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   would be a theorem of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
  , so 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   would not be consistent. Hence, conservative extensions do not bear the risk of introducing new inconsistencies. This can also be seen as a methodology for writing and structuring large theories: start with a theory, 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{0}}
  , that is known (or assumed) to be consistent, and successively build conservative extensions 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
  , ... of it.
Recently, conservative extensions have been used for defining a notion of module for ontologies: if an ontology is formalized as a logical theory, a subtheory is a module if the whole ontology is a conservative extension of the subtheory.
An extension which is not conservative may be called a proper extension.

Model-theoretic conservative extension
With model-theoretic means, a stronger notion is obtained: an extension 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
   of a theory 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   is model-theoretically conservative if 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
        ⊆
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}\subseteq T_{2}}
   and every model of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   can be expanded to a model of 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{2}}
  . Each model-theoretic conservative extension also is a (proof-theoretic) conservative extension in the above sense. The model theoretic notion has the advantage over the proof theoretic one that it does not depend so much on the language at hand; on the other hand, it is usually harder to establish model theoretic conservativity.
