Background
The underworld of Boca de Lixo was an attraction for Cinema Marginal protagonists, most remarkably represented by Rogério Sganzerla's manifesto film O Bandido da Luz Vermelha (1968), that depicted the story of criminal João Acácio Pereira da Costa. The 1970s saw an influx of production companies to the area and producers such as Antônio Polo Galante, David Cardoso, Nelson Teixeira Mendes, Juan Bajon, Cláudio Cunha, Aníbal Massaini Neto made investments in Boca de Lixo. The result was cinema da Boca, low-budget films with superficial content, produced for quick returns to investors. Although identified foremost with pornochanchadas, Boca was the center of a set of various subgenres of exploitation films including comedies, crime films, action films, and kung fu films. The end of censorship in Brazilian cinema after the fall of the military regime in 1985, pornographic films began to be produced as well.
