In mathematics, if 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is a subset of 
  
    
      
        B
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle B,}
   then the inclusion map (also inclusion function, insertion, or canonical injection) is the function 
  
    
      
        ι
      
    
    {\displaystyle \iota }
   that sends each element 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   to 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   treated as an element of 
  
    
      
        B
        :
      
    
    {\displaystyle B:}
  

A "hooked arrow" (U+21AA ↪ RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH HOOK) is sometimes used in place of the function arrow above to denote an inclusion map; thus:

(However, some authors use this hooked arrow for any embedding.)
This and other analogous injective functions from substructures are sometimes called natural injections.
Given any morphism 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   between objects 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  , if there is an inclusion map 
  
    
      
        ι
        :
        A
        →
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle \iota :A\to X}
   into the domain 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  , then one can form the restriction 
  
    
      
        f
        
        ι
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\,\iota }
   of 
  
    
      
        f
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f.}
    In many instances, one can also construct a canonical inclusion into the codomain 
  
    
      
        R
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle R\to Y}
   known as the range of 
  
    
      
        f
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f.}

Applications of inclusion maps
Inclusion maps tend to be homomorphisms of algebraic structures; thus, such inclusion maps are embeddings.  More precisely, given a substructure closed under some operations, the inclusion map will be an embedding for tautological reasons. For example, for some binary operation 
  
    
      
        ⋆
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \star ,}
   to require that

is simply to say that 
  
    
      
        ⋆
      
    
    {\displaystyle \star }
   is consistently computed in the sub-structure and the large structure. The case of a unary operation is similar; but one should also look at nullary operations, which pick out a constant element. Here the point is that closure means such constants must already be given in the substructure.
Inclusion maps are seen in algebraic topology where if 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is a strong deformation retract of 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   the inclusion map yields an isomorphism between all homotopy groups (that is, it is a homotopy equivalence).
Inclusion maps in geometry come in different kinds: for example embeddings of submanifolds. Contravariant objects (which is to say, objects that have pullbacks; these are called covariant in an older and unrelated terminology) such as differential forms restrict to submanifolds, giving a mapping in the other direction. Another example, more sophisticated, is that of affine schemes, for which the inclusions

and

may be different morphisms, where 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   is a commutative ring and 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
   is an ideal of 
  
    
      
        R
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle R.}
