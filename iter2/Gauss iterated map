In mathematics, the Gauss map (also known as Gaussian map or mouse map), is a nonlinear iterated map of the reals into a real interval given by the Gaussian function:

  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
        =
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        −
        α
        
          x
          
            n
          
          
            2
          
        
        )
        +
        β
        ,
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n+1}=\exp(-\alpha x_{n}^{2})+\beta ,\,}
  where α and β are real parameters. 
Named after Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, the function maps the bell shaped Gaussian function similar to the logistic map.

Properties
In the parameter real space 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n}}
   can be chaotic. The map is also called the mouse map because its bifurcation diagram resembles a mouse (see Figures).
