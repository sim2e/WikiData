Alexey Petrovich Stakhov  (Russian: Алексей Петрович Стахов Ukrainian: Олексій Петрович Стахов; May 7, 1939 – January 25, 2021) is a Ukrainian mathematician, inventor and engineer, who has made contributions to the theory of Fibonacci numbers and the "Golden Section" and their applications in computer science and measurement theory and technology. Doctor of computer science (1972), professor (1974). Author of over 500 publications, 14 books and  65 international patents.

Biography
Born May 7, 1939, in Partizany, Kherson region, Ukraine, USSR. In 1956 graduated with honours from Rivne village high school. Same year became a student of the Mining Faculty of the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (now the National Technical University of Ukraine “Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”). In 1959, transferred to the Radio Engineering Faculty of Kharkiv Aviation Institute (now the National Aerospace University of Ukraine). After graduation, worked for two years as an engineer in the Kharkiv Electrical Instrument Design Bureau (now the space technology company “Khartron”). "Khartron" was one of the top secret space companies of the Soviet Union. It was engaged in the research, development and manufacture of automatic control systems for missiles and space craft on board systems. Through working there Stakhov obtained thorough practical engineering experience and published his first scientific papers. Later he worked at the universities of Russia and Ukraine (Kharkiv Institute of Radio Electronics, Taganrog Radio Engineering Institute, Vinnytsia Technical University, Vinnytsia Agricultural University, Vinnytsia Pedagogic University). He was a visiting professor at many universities abroad (Austria, Germany, Libya, Mozambique). Since 2004, he lived and worked in Canada.

Brief description of research and scientific achievements
Created a new direction in the measurement theory, the algorithmic measurement theory described in his book – A.P. Stakhov. "Introduction into Algorithmic Measurement Theory" (Moscow: Soviet Radio, 1977).
Created the theory of the redundant number systems based on the generalised Fibonacci numbers (Fibonacci p-codes) and the generalised golden proportions (codes of the golden p-proportion) The principals of the Fibonacci p-codes and the new computer arithmetic based on them are described in his book – A.P. Stakhov. "Introduction into Algorithmic Measurement Theory" (Moscow: Soviet Radio, 1977). The fundamentals of the theory of the codes of the golden p-proportion are stated in the book – AP Stakhov. The Codes of the Golden Proportion (Moscow, Radio and Communication, 1984).
Put forward the concept of "Fibonacci computers". The international priority of this invention was protected by the Soviet Union in an unprecedented patenting operation by Soviet standards, resulting in 65 international patents, covering the territories of the United States, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada and other countries.
Elaborated and evolved the concept "Mathematics of Harmony", which goes back in its foundations to Euclid's “Elements” (III c. BC), "Divina Proportione" (Divine proportion) by Luca Pacioli (1509), Harmonice Mundi (Harmony of the World) by Johannes Kepler (1619). For the first time the concept of "Mathematics of Harmony" in relation to the achievements of modern science was presented by Prof. Stakhov in a speech "The Golden Section and Modern Harmony Mathematics," made at the seventh International Conference "Fibonacci Numbers and Their Applications" (Austria, Graz, 1996). The book "The Mathematics of Harmony. From Euclid to Contemporary Mathematics and Computer Science" – 748 pages (World Scientific, 2009) is Stakhov's main scientific achievement in this field.
Published over 500 scientific works, among them 14 books, 65 international patents, 130 USSR invention certificates. During his work in Canada (2004–2012) published over 30 articles in international journals (Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, Applied Mathematics, Arc Combinatoria, Visual Mathematics, etc.).
Alexey Stakhov prepared 30 PhD students, five of Stakhov's PhD students, became Doctors of Sciences.
