In proof theory, ordinal analysis assigns ordinals (often large countable ordinals) to mathematical theories as a measure of their strength. 
If theories have the same proof-theoretic ordinal they are often equiconsistent, and if one theory has a larger proof-theoretic ordinal than another it can often prove the consistency of the second theory.
In addition to obtaining the proof-theoretic ordinal of a theory, in practice ordinal analysis usually also yields various other pieces of information about the theory being analyzed, for example characterizations of the classes of provably recursive, hyperarithmetical, or

History
The field of ordinal analysis was formed when Gerhard Gentzen in 1934 used cut elimination to prove, in modern terms, that the proof-theoretic ordinal of Peano arithmetic is ε0. See Gentzen's consistency proof.

Definition
Ordinal analysis concerns true, effective (recursive) theories that can interpret a sufficient portion of arithmetic to make statements about ordinal notations. 
The proof-theoretic ordinal of such a theory 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   is the supremum of the order types of all ordinal notations (necessarily recursive, see next section) that the theory can prove are well founded—the supremum of all ordinals 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   for which there exists a notation 
  
    
      
        o
      
    
    {\displaystyle o}
   in Kleene's sense such that 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   proves that 
  
    
      
        o
      
    
    {\displaystyle o}
   is an ordinal notation. Equivalently, it is the supremum of all ordinals 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   such that there exists a recursive relation 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   on 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   (the set of natural numbers) that well-orders it with ordinal 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   and such that 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   proves transfinite induction of arithmetical statements for 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
  .

Ordinal notations
Some theories, such as subsystems of second-order arithmetic, have no conceptualization of or way to make arguments about transfinite ordinals. For example, to formalize what it means for a subsystem of Z2 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   to "prove 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   well-ordered", we instead construct an ordinal notation 
  
    
      
        (
        A
        ,
        
          
            
              <
              ~
            
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (A,{\tilde {<}})}
   with order type 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  . 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   can now work with various transfinite induction principles along 
  
    
      
        (
        A
        ,
        
          
            
              <
              ~
            
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (A,{\tilde {<}})}
  , which substitute for reasoning about set-theoretic ordinals.
However, some pathological notation systems exist that are unexpectedly difficult to work with. For example, Rathjen gives a primitive recursive notation system 
  
    
      
        (
        
          N
        
        ,
        
          <
          
            T
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (\mathbb {N} ,<_{T})}
   that is well-founded iff PA is consistent, despite having order type 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
   - including such a notation in the ordinal analysis of PA would result in the false equality 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
            T
            O
            (
            P
            A
            )
          
        
        =
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {PTO(PA)}}=\omega }
  .

This is a list of symbols used in this table:

ψ represents various ordinal collapsing functions as defined in their respective citations.
Ψ represents either Rathjen's or Stegert's Psi.
φ represents Veblen's function.
ω represents the first transfinite ordinal.
εα represents the epsilon numbers.
Γα represents the gamma numbers (Γ0 is the Feferman–Schütte ordinal)
Ωα represent the uncountable ordinals (Ω1, abbreviated Ω, is ω1). Countability is considered necessary for an ordinal to be regarded as proof theoretic.This is a list of the abbreviations used in this table:
