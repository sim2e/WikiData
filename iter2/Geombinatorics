Alexander Soifer is a Russian-born American mathematician and mathematics author. His works include over 400 articles and 13 books.
Soifer obtained his Ph.D. in 1973 and has been a professor of mathematics at the University of Colorado since 1979. He was visiting fellow at Princeton University from 2002 to 2004, and again in 2006–2007. Soifer also teaches courses on art history and European cinema. His publications include 13 books and over 400 articles.
Every spring, Soifer, along with other mathematician colleagues, sponsors the Colorado Mathematical Olympiad (CMO) at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. Soifer compiles and writes most of the problems for the contest. The CMO was founded by Soifer on April 18, 1983.For the Olympiad's 30th anniversary, the university produced a film about it. In May 2018, in recognition of 35 years of leadership, the judges and winners decided in 2018 to rename the Colorado Mathematical Olympiad to the Soifer Mathematical Olympiad.
In 1991 Soifer founded the research quarterly Geombinatorics, and publishes it with the Geombinatorics editorial board.In July 2006 at the University of Cambridge, Soifer was presented with the Paul Erdős Award by the World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions.
Soifer was the President of the World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions from 2012 to 2018. His Erdős number is 1.

Geombinatorics
Geombinatorics is a quarterly scientific journal of mathematics. It was established by editor-in-chief Alexander Soifer in 1991 and is published by the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. The journal covers problems in discrete, convex, and combinatorial geometry, as well as related areas. The journal is indexed in Zentralblatt MATH, Excellence in Research for Australia, and MathSciNet.
