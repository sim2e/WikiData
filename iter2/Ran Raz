Ran Raz (Hebrew: רָן רָז) is a computer scientist who works in the area of computational complexity theory. He was a professor in the faculty of mathematics and computer science at the Weizmann Institute. He is now a professor of computer science at Princeton University.Ran Raz received his Ph.D. at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1992 under Avi Wigderson and Michael Ben-Or.Ran Raz is well known for his work on interactive proof systems. His two most-cited papers are Raz (1998) on multi-prover interactive proofs and Raz & Safra (1997) on probabilistically checkable proofs.Ran Raz received the Erdős Prize in 2002. His work has been awarded in the top conferences in theoretical computer science. In 2004, he received the best paper award in ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) for Raz (2004), and the best paper award in IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC) for Raz & Shpilka (2004). In 2008, the work Moshkovitz & Raz (2008) received the best paper award in IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS).
