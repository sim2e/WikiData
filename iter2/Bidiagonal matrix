In mathematics, a bidiagonal matrix is a banded matrix with non-zero entries along the main diagonal and either the diagonal above or the diagonal below. This means there are exactly two non-zero diagonals in the matrix.
When the diagonal above the main diagonal has the non-zero entries the matrix is upper bidiagonal.  When the diagonal below the main diagonal has the non-zero entries the matrix is lower bidiagonal.
For example, the following matrix is upper bidiagonal:

  
    
      
        
          
            (

Usage
One variant of the QR algorithm starts with reducing a general matrix into a bidiagonal one,
and the singular value decomposition (SVD) uses this method as well.

Bidiagonalization
Bidiagonalization allows guaranteed accuracy when using floating-point arithmetic to compute singular values.
