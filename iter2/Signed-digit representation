In mathematical notation for numbers, a signed-digit representation is a positional numeral system with a set of signed digits used to encode the integers.
Signed-digit representation can be used to accomplish fast addition of integers because it can eliminate chains of dependent carries.  In the binary numeral system, a special case signed-digit representation is the non-adjacent form, which can offer speed benefits with minimal space overhead.

History
Challenges in calculation stimulated early authors Colson (1726) and Cauchy (1840) to use signed-digit representation. The further step of replacing negated digits with new ones was suggested by Selling (1887) and Cajori (1928).
In 1928, Florian Cajori noted the recurring theme of signed digits, starting with Colson (1726) and Cauchy (1840). In his book History of Mathematical Notations, Cajori titled the section "Negative numerals". For completeness, Colson uses examples and describes addition (pp. 163–4), multiplication (pp. 165–6) and division (pp. 170–1) using a table of multiples of the divisor. He explains the convenience of approximation by truncation in multiplication. Colson also devised an instrument (Counting Table) that calculated using signed digits.
Eduard Selling advocated inverting the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to indicate the negative sign. He also suggested snie, jes, jerd, reff, and niff as names to use vocally. Most of the other early sources used a bar over a digit to indicate a negative sign for it. Another German usage of signed-digits was described in 1902 in Klein's encyclopedia.

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}}
   can be used for a signed-digit representation if it's associated with a unique function 
  
    
      
        
          f

          f
          
            
              D
            
          
        
        (

    {\displaystyle f_{\mathcal {D}}(d_{i})\equiv i{\bmod {b}}}

        <

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq i<b.}
   
This function, 
  
    
      
        
          f

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\mathcal {D}},}
   is what rigorously and formally establishes how integer values are assigned to the symbols/glyphs in 
  
    
      
        
          
            D
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}.}
   One benefit of this formalism is that the definition of "the integers" (however they may be defined) is not conflated with any particular system for writing/representing them; in this way, these two distinct (albeit closely related) concepts are kept separate.

  , there exist a corresponding negative digit 
  
    
      
        
          d
          
            −
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle d_{-}}

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{\mathcal {D}}(d_{+})=-f_{\mathcal {D}}(d_{-})}

            −
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle d_{-}\in {\mathcal {D}}_{-}}

In written and spoken language
Indo-Aryan languages
The oral and written forms of numbers in the Indo-Aryan languages use a negative numeral (e.g., "un" in Hindi and Bengali, "un" or "unna" in Punjabi, "ekon" in Marathi) for the numbers between 11 and 90 that end with a nine. The numbers followed by their names are shown for Punjabi below (the prefix "ik" means "one"):
19 unni, 20 vih, 21 ikki
29 unatti, 30 tih, 31 ikatti
39 untali, 40 chali, 41 iktali
49 unanja, 50 panjah, 51 ikvanja
59 unahat, 60 sath, 61 ikahat
69 unattar, 70 sattar, 71 ikhattar
79 unasi, 80 assi, 81 ikiasi
89 unanve, 90 nabbe, 91 ikinnaven.Similarly, the Sesotho language utilizes negative numerals to form 8's and 9's.

8 robeli (/Ro-bay-dee/)  meaning "break two" i.e. two fingers down
9 robong (/Ro-bong/) meaning "break one" i.e. one finger down

Classical Latin
In Classical Latin, integers 18 and 19 did not even have a spoken, nor written form including corresponding parts for "eight" or "nine" in practice - despite them being in existence. Instead, in Classic Latin,

18 = duodēvīgintī ("two taken from twenty"), (IIXX or XIIX),
19 = ūndēvīgintī ("one taken from twenty"), (IXX or XIX)
20 = vīgintī ("twenty"), (XX).For upcoming integer numerals [28, 29, 38, 39, ..., 88, 89] the additive form in the language had been much more common, however, for the listed numbers, the above form was still preferred. Hence, approaching thirty, numerals were expressed as:
28 = duodētrīgintā ("two taken from thirty"), less frequently also yet vīgintī octō / octō et vīgintī ("twenty eight / eight and twenty"), (IIXXX or XXIIX versus XXVIII, latter having been fully outcompeted.)
29 = ūndētrīgintā ("one taken from thirty") despite the less preferred form was also at their disposal.This is one of the main foundations of contemporary historians' reasoning, explaining why the subtractive I- and II- was so common in this range of cardinals compared to other ranges. Numerals 98 and 99 could also be expressed in both forms, yet "two to hundred" might have sounded a bit odd - clear evidence is the scarce occurrence of these numbers written down in a subtractive fashion in authentic sources.

Finnish Language
There is yet another language having this feature (by now, only in traces), however, still in active use today. This is the Finnish Language, where the (spelled out) numerals are used this way should a digit of 8 or 9 occur. The scheme is like this:
1 = "yksi" (Note: yhd- or yht- mostly when about to be declined; e.g. "yhdessä" = "together, as one [entity]")
2 = "kaksi" (Also note: kahde-, kahte- when declined)
3 = "kolme"
4 = "neljä"...

7 = "seitsemän"
8 = "kah(d)eksan" (two left [for it to reach it])
9 = "yh(d)eksän" (one left [for it to reach it])
10 = "kymmenen" (ten)Above list is no special case, it consequently appears in larger cardinals as well, e.g.:

399 = "kolmesataayhdeksänkymmentäyhdeksän"Emphasizing of these attributes stay present even in the shortest colloquial forms of numerals:

1 = "yy"
2 = "kaa"
3 = "koo"...

7 = "seiska"
8 = "kasi"
9 = "ysi"
10 = "kymppi"However, this phenomenon has no influence on written numerals, the Finnish use the standard Western-Arabic decimal notation.

Time keeping
In the English language it is common to refer to times as, for example, 'seven to three', 'to' performing the negation.

Other systems
There exist other signed-digit bases such that the base 
  
    
      
        b
        ≠
        
          b
          
            +
          
        
        +
        
          b
          
            −
          
        
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\neq b_{+}+b_{-}+1}
  . A notable examples of this is Booth encoding, which has a digit set 
  
    
      
        
          
            D
          
        
        =
        {
        
          
            
              1
              ¯
            
          
        
        ,
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}=\lbrace {\bar {1}},0,1\rbrace }
   with 
  
    
      
        
          b
          
            +
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle b_{+}=1}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          b
          
            −
          
        
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle b_{-}=1}
  , but which uses a base 
  
    
      
        b
        =
        2
        <
        3
        =
        
          b
          
            +
          
        
        +
        
          b
          
            −
          
        
        +
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle b=2<3=b_{+}+b_{-}+1}
  . The standard binary numeral system would only use digits of value 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lbrace 0,1\rbrace }
  .

          0111

  The non-adjacent form (NAF) of Booth encoding does guarantee a unique representation for every integer value. However, this only applies for integer values. For example, consider the following repeating binary numbers in NAF,

  
    
      
        
          
            2
            3
          
        
        =
        0.
        
          
            
              10
              ¯
            
          
          
            
              D
            
          
        
        =
