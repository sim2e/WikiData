I've been trying to figure out how to merge the different computer security articles Mobile security, Computer security, Cyber security and countermeasure, Network security, Internet security, World Wide Web#security, Information security, Cyberwarfare, etc. and thought a great way to start would be to alert everyone of the existence of a wide range of unsynched and duplicate content, using this template.  I welcome comments and additions -  I know my list is incomplete.Timtempleton (talk) 22:15, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

Information security is the broader parent topic. Moved template to title, {{Information security}}. Sagecandor (talk) 06:04, 21 December 2016 (UTC)
