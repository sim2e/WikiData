Academician Mikhail Aleksandrovich Fedonkin (Russian: Михаи́л Алекса́ндрович Федо́нкин; born June 19, 1946) is a Russian paleontologist specializing in documentation of the earliest animals' body fossils, tracks, and trails. He has also described numerous Vendian-aged fossils including Hiemalora, Cephalonega, and Nimbia occlusa.

Early life
Fedonkin was born in Orekhovo-Zuevo, Moscow Region, Russia.
In 1969, Fedonkin presented a thesis titled "Biostratigraphy and paleontology of the Late Precambrian deposits of Kharaulakh Mountains, Northern Yakutia (Sakha)" to earn his MSc in Geology from Moscow State University. He went on to obtain a PhD in Stratigraphy\Paleontology (1978) and a Doctorate of Science in Paleobiology (1985) from the Geological Institute, USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow for his dissertations on "Precambrian fauna and trace fossils from the Russian Platform north" and "Non-skeletal fauna of the Vendian and its place in the evolution of metazoans", respectively.

Career
In 1971, Fedonkin was a junior scientific researcher at the Geological Institute, USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow. In 1978, he became a senior scientific researcher at the Paleontological Institute, USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow.
In 1985 he was promoted to be the Lead Scientific Researcher.
Since 1992, Fedonkin has been the Head of the laboratory of Precambrian paleobiology at the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow.
Over his career he has completed field work in Australia, Canada, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain and the United States.

Awards
1997, awarded the Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal by the National Academy of Sciences
2000, awarded the Peter The Great Medal for the merits in the revival of science and economics in Russia by the International Academy of Science on Nature and Society.
