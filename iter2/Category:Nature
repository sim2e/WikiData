Nature (also called the material world, the material universe, the natural world, and the natural universe) is all matter and energy in the universe.
In scale, 'nature' includes everything from the subatomic to the universal. This includes all things animal, plant, and mineral; all natural resources and events (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes). It also includes the behavior of living organisms, and the processes (e.g., erosion, metamorphism, fossilization) associated with inanimate objects.
