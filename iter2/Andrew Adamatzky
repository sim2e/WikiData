Andrew Adamatzky is a British computer scientist, who is a Director of the Unconventional Computing Laboratory and Professor in Unconventional Computing at the Department of Computer Science and Creative Technology, University of the West of England, Bristol, United Kingdom.
Adamatzky is known for his research in unconventional computing. In particular, he has worked on chemical computers using reaction–diffusion processes.
He has used slime moulds to plan potential routes for roadway systems and as components of nanorobotic systems, and discovered that they seek out valerian tablets, promoted as a herbal sedative, in preference to nutrients. He has also shown that the billiard balls in billiard-ball computers may be replaced by soldier crabs.Adamatzky is a director of the Unconventional Computing Laboratory, founding Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Cellular Automata (OCP Science, 2005–) and the International Journal of Unconventional Computing (OCP Science, 2005–), and current Editor-in-Chief of Parallel Processing Letters (World Scientific, 2017–).He appears in the 2014 documentary The Creeping Garden and in the 2019 documentary Le Blob.
