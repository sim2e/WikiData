In mathematics, more specifically in general topology and related branches, a net or Moore–Smith sequence is a generalization of the notion of a sequence. In essence, a sequence is a function whose domain is the natural numbers. The codomain of this function is usually some topological space.
The motivation for generalizing the notion of a sequence is that, in the context of topology, sequences do not fully encode all information about functions between topological spaces. In particular, the following two conditions are, in general, not equivalent for a map 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   between topological spaces 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  :

The map 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is continuous in the topological sense;
Given any point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   and any sequence in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   converging to 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   the composition of 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   with this sequence converges to 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)}
   (continuous in the sequential sense).While condition 1 always guarantees condition 2, the converse is not necessarily true if the topological spaces are not both first-countable. In particular, the two conditions are equivalent for metric spaces. The spaces for which the converse holds are the sequential spaces.
The concept of a net, first introduced by E. H. Moore and Herman L. Smith in 1922, is to generalize the notion of a sequence so that the above conditions (with "sequence" being replaced by "net" in condition 2) are in fact equivalent for all maps of topological spaces. In particular, rather than being defined on a countable linearly ordered set, a net is defined on an arbitrary directed set. This allows for theorems similar to the assertion that the conditions 1 and 2 above are equivalent to hold in the context of topological spaces that do not necessarily have a countable or linearly ordered neighbourhood basis around a point. Therefore, while sequences do not encode sufficient information about functions between topological spaces, nets do, because collections of open sets in topological spaces are much like directed sets in behavior. The term "net" was coined by John L. Kelley.Nets are one of the many tools used in topology to generalize certain concepts that may not be general enough in the context of metric spaces. A related notion, that of the filter, was developed in 1937 by Henri Cartan.

Definitions
Any function whose domain is a directed set is called a net. If this function takes values in some set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   then it may also be referred to as a net in 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
   Explicitly, a net in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a function of the form 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        A
        →
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:A\to X}
   where 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is some directed set. Elements of a net's domain are called its indices. 
A directed set is a non-empty set 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   together with a preorder, typically automatically assumed to be denoted by 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq \,}
   (unless indicated otherwise), with the property that it is also (upward) directed, which means that for any 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
        ∈
        A
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,b\in A,}
   there exists some 
  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in A}
   such that 
  
    
      
        a
        ≤
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\leq c}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
        ≤
        c
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\leq c.}
   
In words, this property means that given any two elements (of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  ), there is always some element that is "above" both of them (that is, that is greater than or equal to each of them); in this way, directed sets generalize the notion of "a direction" in a mathematically rigorous way. 
The natural numbers 
  
    
      
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }
   together with the usual integer comparison 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq \,}
   preorder form the archetypical example of a directed set. Indeed, a net whose domain is the natural numbers is a sequence because by definition, a sequence in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is just a function from 
  
    
      
        
          N
        
        =
        {
        1
        ,
        2
        ,
        …
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} =\{1,2,\ldots \}}
   into 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
   It is in this way that nets are generalizations of sequences. Importantly though, unlike the natural numbers, directed sets are not required to be total orders or even partial orders. 
Moreover, directed sets are allowed to have greatest elements and/or maximal elements, which is the reason why when using nets, caution is advised when using the induced strict preorder 
  
    
      
        
        <
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,<\,}
   instead of the original (non-strict) preorder 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq }
  ; in particular, if a directed set 
  
    
      
        (
        A
        ,
        ≤
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (A,\leq )}
   has a greatest element 
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in A}
   then there does not exist any 
  
    
      
        b
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\in A}
   such that 
  
    
      
        a
        <
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a<b}
   (in contrast, there always exists some 
  
    
      
        b
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\in A}
   such that 
  
    
      
        a
        ≤
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\leq b}
  ).
Nets are frequently denoted using notation that is similar to (and inspired by) that used with sequences. 
A net in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   may be denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A},}
   where unless there is reason to think otherwise, it should automatically be assumed that the set 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is directed and that its associated preorder is denoted by 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq .}
   
However, notation for nets varies with some authors using, for instance, angled brackets 
  
    
      
        
          
            ⟨
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            ⟩
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\langle x_{a}\right\rangle _{a\in A}}
   instead of parentheses. 
A net in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   may also be written as 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A},}
   which expresses the fact that this net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   is a function 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        :
        A
        →
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }:A\to X}
   whose value at an element 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   in its domain is denoted by 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            a
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{a}}
   instead of the usual parentheses notation 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        (
        a
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }(a)}
   that is typically used with functions (this subscript notation being taken from sequences). As in the field of algebraic topology, the filled disk or "bullet" denotes the location where arguments to the net (that is, elements 
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in A}
   of the net's domain) are placed; it helps emphasize that the net is a function and also reduces the number of indices and other symbols that must be written when referring to it later.
Nets are primarily used in the fields of Analysis and Topology, where they are used to characterize many important topological properties that (in general), sequences are unable to characterize (this shortcoming of sequences motivated the study of sequential spaces and Fréchet–Urysohn spaces). Nets are intimately related to filters, which are also often used in topology. Every net may be associated with a filter and every filter may be associated with a net, where the properties of these associated objects are closely tied together (see the article about Filters in topology for more details). Nets directly generalize sequences and they may often be used very similarly to sequences. Consequently, the learning curve for using nets is typically much less steep than that for filters, which is why many mathematicians, especially analysts, prefer them over filters. However, filters, and especially ultrafilters, have some important technical advantages over nets that ultimately result in nets being encountered much less often than filters outside of the fields of Analysis and Topology.
A subnet is not merely the restriction of a net 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   to a directed subset of 
  
    
      
        A
        ;
      
    
    {\displaystyle A;}
   see the linked page for a definition.

Examples of nets
Every non-empty totally ordered set is directed. Therefore, every function on such a set is a net. In particular, the natural numbers with the usual order form such a set, and a sequence is a function on the natural numbers, so every sequence is a net.
Another important example is as follows. Given a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in a topological space, let 
  
    
      
        
          N
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N_{x}}
   denote the set of all neighbourhoods containing 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   Then 
  
    
      
        
          N
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N_{x}}
   is a directed set, where the direction is given by reverse inclusion, so that 
  
    
      
        S
        ≥
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\geq T}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is contained in 
  
    
      
        T
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle T.}
   For 
  
    
      
        S
        ∈
        
          N
          
            x
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\in N_{x},}
   let 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            S
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{S}}
   be a point in 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   Then 
  
    
      
        
          (
          
            x
            
              S
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(x_{S}\right)}
   is a net. As 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   increases with respect to 
  
    
      
        
        ≥
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\geq ,}
   the points 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            S
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{S}}
   in the net are constrained to lie in decreasing neighbourhoods of 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   so intuitively speaking, we are led to the idea that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            S
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{S}}
   must tend towards 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in some sense. We can make this limiting concept precise.
A subnet of a sequence is not necessarily a sequence. 
For an example, let 
  
    
      
        X
        =
        
          
            R
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X=\mathbb {R} ^{n}}
   and let 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}=0}
   for every 
  
    
      
        i
        ∈
        
          N
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\in \mathbb {N} ,}
   so that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        (
        0
        
          )
          
            i
            ∈
            
              N
            
          
        
        :
        
          N
        
        →
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=(0)_{i\in \mathbb {N} }:\mathbb {N} \to X}
   is the constant zero sequence. 
Let 
  
    
      
        I

   be directed by the usual order

   because it is not even a sequence since its domain is an uncountable set).

Limits of nets
A net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}}
   is said to be eventually or residually in a set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   if there exists some 
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in A}
   such that for every 
  
    
      
        b
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\in A}
   with 
  
    
      
        b
        ≥
        a
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\geq a,}
   the point 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            b
          
        
        ∈
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{b}\in S.}
   
And it is said to be frequently or cofinally in 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   if for every 
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in A}
   there exists some 
  
    
      
        b
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\in A}
   such that 
  
    
      
        b
        ≥
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\geq a}
   and

    {\displaystyle x_{b}\in S.}
   
A point is called a limit point (respectively, cluster point) of a net if that net is eventually (respectively, cofinally) in every neighborhood of that point.
Explicitly, a point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   is said to be an accumulation point or cluster point of a net if for every neighborhood 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   the net is frequently in 
  
    
      
        U
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle U.}
  A point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   is called a limit point or limit of the net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   if (and only if)

for every open neighborhood 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   the net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   is eventually in 
  
    
      
        U
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle U,}
  in which case, this net is then also said to converge to/towards 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and to have 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   as a limit.
Intuitively, convergence of a net 
  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}}
   means that the values 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            a
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{a}}
   come and stay as close as we want to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   for large enough 
  
    
      
        a
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle a.}
   
The example net given above on the neighborhood system of a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   does indeed converge to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   according to this definition.
Notation for limits
If the net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   converges in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   to a point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   then this fact may be expressed by writing any of the following:

where if the topological space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is clear from context then the words "in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  " may be omitted.
If 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          

          
        
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{}x_{\bullet }\to x}
   in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and if this limit in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is unique (uniqueness in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   means that if 
  
    
      
        y
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle y\in X}
   is such that 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          

          
        
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        →
        y
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{}x_{\bullet }\to y,}
   then necessarily 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=y}
  ) then this fact may be indicated by writing

where an equals sign is used in place of the arrow 
  
    
      
        →
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \to .}
   In a Hausdorff space, every net has at most one limit so the limit of a convergent net in a Hausdorff space is always unique. 
Some authors instead use the notation "
  
    
      
        
          lim
          

          
        
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{}x_{\bullet }=x}
  " to mean 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          

          
        
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{}x_{\bullet }\to x}
   without also requiring that the limit be unique; however, if this notation is defined in this way then the equals sign 
  
    
      
        =
      
    
    {\displaystyle =}
   is no longer guaranteed to denote a transitive relationship and so no longer denotes equality. Specifically, without the uniqueness requirement, if 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,y\in X}
   are distinct and if each is also a limit of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   then 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          

          
        
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{}x_{\bullet }=x}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          lim
          

          
        
        
          x

        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim _{}x_{\bullet }=y}
   could be written (using the equals sign 
  
    
      
        =
      
    
    {\displaystyle =}
  ) despite 
  
    
      
        x
        =
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle x=y}
   being false.
Bases and subbases
Given a subbase 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   for the topology on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   (where note that every base for a topology is also a subbase) and given a point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X,}
   a net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   converges to 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   if and only if it is eventually in every neighborhood 
  
    
      
        U
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U\in {\mathcal {B}}}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   This characterization extends to neighborhood subbases (and so also neighborhood bases) of the given point 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
  
Convergence in metric spaces
Suppose 
  
    
      
        (
        X
        ,
        d
        )

   is not empty, then the axiom of choice would (in general) still be needed to conclude that the projections 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            i

    {\displaystyle \pi _{i}:{\textstyle \prod }X_{\bullet }\to X_{i}}
   are surjective maps.
The axiom of choice is equivalent to Tychonoff's theorem, which states that the product of any collection of compact topological spaces is compact. 
But if every compact space is also Hausdorff, then the so called "Tychonoff's theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces" can be used instead, which is equivalent to the ultrafilter lemma and so strictly weaker than the axiom of choice. 
Nets can be used to give short proofs of both version of Tychonoff's theorem by using the characterization of net convergence given above together with the fact that a space is compact if and only if every net has a convergent subnet.

Ultranets
A net

        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is called a universal net or an ultranet if for every subset 
  
    
      
        S
        ⊆
        X
        ,

  Ultranets are closely related to ultrafilters. 
Every constant net is an ultranet. Every subnet of an ultranet is an ultranet. Every net has some subnet that is an ultranet.

Examples of limits of nets
Every limit of a sequence and limit of a function can be interpreted as a limit of a net (as described below). 
The definition of the value of a Riemann integral can be interpreted as a limit of a net of Riemann sums where the net's directed set is the set of all partitions of the interval of integration, partially ordered by inclusion.

   However, there does not exist any sequence in

   in a topological space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   can be considered a net in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   defined on 
  
    
      
        
          N
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} .}
  
The net is eventually in a subset 
  
    
      
        S

        S

        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   of 
  
    
      
        L

    {\displaystyle L,}
   the net is eventually in 
  
    
      
        V
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle V.}
  
The net is frequently in a subset 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   if and only if for every

          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle N\in \mathbb {N} }
   there exists some integer 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq N}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
        ∈
        S
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a_{n}\in S,}
   that is, if and only if infinitely many elements of the sequence are in 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   Thus a point 
  
    
      
        y
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle y\in X}
   is a cluster point of the net if and only if every neighborhood 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   of 
  
    
      
        y
      
    
    {\displaystyle y}
   contains infinitely many elements of the sequence.

Function from a metric space to a topological space
Fix a point 
  
    
      
        c

        M

            R

    {\displaystyle c:=0}
   being the origin, for example) and direct the set

   reversely according to distance from 
  
    
      
        c

        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(j,c)\leq d(i,c).}
   In other words, the relation is "has at least the same distance to 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}

Subnets
The analogue of "subsequence" for nets is the notion of a "subnet". There are several different non-equivalent definitions of "subnet" and this article will use the definition introduced in 1970 by Stephen Willard, which is as follows: 
If 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              s
              
                i
              
            
            )
          
          
            i
            ∈
            I
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{\bullet }=\left(s_{i}\right)_{i\in I}}
   are nets then 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{\bullet }}
   is called a subnet or Willard-subnet of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   if there exists an order-preserving map 
  
    
      
        h
        :
        I
        →
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle h:I\to A}

        (
        I
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(I)}
   is a cofinal subset of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and 
 
The map 
  
    
      
        h
        :
        I
        →
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle h:I\to A}
   is called order-preserving and an order homomorphism if whenever 
  
    
      
        i
        ≤
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\leq j}
   then 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        i
        )
        ≤
        h
        (
        j
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle h(i)\leq h(j).}
   
The set 
  
    
      
        h
        (
        I
        )

   being cofinal in 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   means that for every 
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        A
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in A,}
   there exists some 
  
    
      
        b
        ∈
        h
        (
        I
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\in h(I)}
   such that 
  
    
      
        b
        ≥
        a
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\geq a.}

Properties
Virtually all concepts of topology can be rephrased in the language of nets and limits. This may be useful to guide the intuition since the notion of limit of a net is very similar to that of limit of a sequence. The following set of theorems and lemmas help cement that similarity:

  Open sets and characterizations of topologies

A subset 
  
    
      
        S
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\subseteq X}
   is open if and only if no net in 
  
    
      
        X
        ∖
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\setminus S}
   converges to a point of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   Also, subset 
  
    
      
        S
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\subseteq X}
   is open if and only if every net converging to an element of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is eventually contained in 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   
It is these characterizations of "open subset" that allow nets to characterize topologies. 
Topologies can also be characterized by closed subsets since a set is open if and only if its complement is closed. So the characterizations of "closed set" in terms of nets can also be used to characterize topologies. 
Continuity
A function

    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   between topological spaces is continuous at a given point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   if and only if for every net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙

    {\displaystyle X}
   then

        f
        
          (
          
            x

        Y
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y.}
   
Said more succinctly, a function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   is continuous if and only if whenever 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }\to x}
   in 
  
    
      
        X

In general, this statement would not be true if the word "net" was replaced by "sequence"; that is, it is necessary to allow for directed sets other than just the natural numbers if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is not a first-countable space (or not a sequential space).

Compactness
A space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is compact if and only if every net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )

        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   has a subnet with a limit in

   This can be seen as a generalization of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and Heine–Borel theorem.

Cluster and limit points
The set of cluster points of a net is equal to the set of limits of its convergent subnets.

A net has a limit if and only if all of its subnets have limits. In that case, every limit of the net is also a limit of every subnet.

Other properties
In general, a net in a space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   can have more than one limit, but if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a Hausdorff space, the limit of a net, if it exists, is unique. Conversely, if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is not Hausdorff, then there exists a net on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   with two distinct limits.  Thus the uniqueness of the limit is equivalent to the Hausdorff condition on the space, and indeed this may be taken as the definition.  This result depends on the directedness condition; a set indexed by a general preorder or partial order may have distinct limit points even in a Hausdorff space.

Cauchy nets
A Cauchy net generalizes the notion of Cauchy sequence to nets defined on uniform spaces.A net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}}
   is a Cauchy net if for every entourage 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   there exists 
  
    
      
        c
        ∈
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\in A}
   such that for all 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
        ≥
        c
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,b\geq c,}
   
  
    
      
        
          (
          
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            ,
            
              x
              
                b
              
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(x_{a},x_{b}\right)}
   is a member of 
  
    
      
        V
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle V.}
   More generally, in a Cauchy space, a net 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   is Cauchy if the filter generated by the net is a Cauchy filter.
A topological vector space (TVS) is called complete if every Cauchy net converges to some point. A normed space, which is a special type of topological vector space, is a complete TVS (equivalently, a Banach space) if and only if every Cauchy sequence converges to some point (a property that is called sequential completeness). Although Cauchy nets are not needed to describe completeness of normed spaces, they are needed to describe completeness of more general (possibly non-normable) topological vector spaces.

Relation to filters
A filter is another idea in topology that allows for a general definition for convergence in general topological spaces. The two ideas are equivalent in the sense that they give the same concept of convergence. More specifically, for every filter base an associated net can be constructed, and convergence of the filter base implies convergence of the associated net—and the other way around (for every net there is a filter base, and convergence of the net implies convergence of the filter base). For instance, any net 
  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A}}
   in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   induces a filter base of tails 
  
    
      
        
          {
          
            
              {
              
                
                  x
                  
                    a
                  
                
                :
                a
                ∈
                A
                ,
                
                  a
                  
                    0
                  
                
                ≤
                a
              
              }
            
            :
            
              a
              
                0
              
            
            ∈
            A
          
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{\left\{x_{a}:a\in A,a_{0}\leq a\right\}:a_{0}\in A\right\}}
   where the filter in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   generated by this filter base is called the net's eventuality filter. This correspondence allows for any theorem that can be proven with one concept to be proven with the other. For instance, continuity of a function from one topological space to the other can be characterized either by the convergence of a net in the domain implying the convergence of the corresponding net in the codomain, or by the same statement with filter bases.
Robert G. Bartle argues that despite their equivalence, it is useful to have both concepts. He argues that nets are enough like sequences to make natural proofs and definitions in analogy to sequences, especially ones using sequential elements, such as is common in analysis, while filters are most useful in algebraic topology. In any case, he shows how the two can be used in combination to prove various theorems in general topology.

Limit superior
Limit superior and limit inferior of a net of real numbers can be defined in a similar manner as for sequences. Some authors work even with more general structures than the real line, like complete lattices.For a net 
  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                a
              
            
            )
          
          
            a
            ∈
            A
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(x_{a}\right)_{a\in A},}
   put

Limit superior of a net of real numbers has many properties analogous to the case of sequences. For example,

where equality holds whenever one of the nets is convergent.
