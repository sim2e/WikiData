In mathematics, an interval exchange transformation is a kind of dynamical system that generalises circle rotation.  The phase space consists of the unit interval, and the transformation acts by cutting the interval into several subintervals, and then permuting these subintervals.  They arise naturally in the study of polygonal billiards and in area-preserving flows.

    {\displaystyle [a_{i},a_{i}+\lambda _{i})}
   by a translation, and it rearranges these subintervals so that the subinterval at position 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   is moved to position

Properties
Any interval exchange transformation 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            π
            ,
            λ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }}
   is a bijection of 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1]}
   to itself that preserves the Lebesgue measure.  It is continuous except at a finite number of points.
The inverse of the interval exchange transformation 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            π
            ,
            λ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }}
   is again an interval exchange transformation.  In fact, it is the transformation 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            
              π

                1
              
            
            ,
            
              λ
              ′
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{\pi ^{-1},\lambda '}}
   where 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            i
          
          ′
        
        =

              π
              
                −
                1

    {\displaystyle \lambda '_{i}=\lambda _{\pi ^{-1}(i)}}
   for all 
  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        i
        ≤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq i\leq n}
  .
If 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=2}
   and 
  
    
      
        π
        =
        (
        12
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi =(12)}
   (in cycle notation), and if we join up the ends of the interval to make a circle, then 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            π
            ,
            λ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }}
   is just a circle rotation.  The Weyl equidistribution theorem then asserts that if the length 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{1}}
   is irrational, then 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            π
            ,
            λ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{\pi ,\lambda }}
   is uniquely ergodic. Roughly speaking, this means that the orbits of points of 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1]}
   are uniformly evenly distributed.  On the other hand, if 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{1}}
   is rational then each point of the interval is periodic, and the period is the denominator of 
  
    
      
        
          λ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda _{1}}
   (written in lowest terms).
If 
  
    
      
        n
        >
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle n>2}
  , and provided

Interval maps have a topological entropy of zero.

Odometers
The dyadic odometer can be understood as an interval exchange transformation of a countable number of intervals. The dyadic odometer is most easily written as the transformation

  This mapping is a measure-preserving homomorphism from the Cantor set to the unit interval, in that it maps the standard Bernoulli measure on the Cantor set to the Lebesgue measure on the unit interval. A visualization of the odometer and its first three iterates appear on the right.

Higher dimensions
Two and higher-dimensional generalizations include polygon exchanges, polyhedral exchanges and piecewise isometries.
