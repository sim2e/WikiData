In mathematics, a hollow matrix may refer to one of several related classes of matrix: a sparse matrix; a matrix with a large block of zeroes; or a matrix with diagonal entries all zero.

Definitions
Sparse
A hollow matrix may be one with "few" non-zero entries: that is, a sparse matrix.

Block of zeroes
A hollow matrix may be a square n × n matrix with an r × s block of zeroes where  r + s > n.

Diagonal entries all zero
A hollow matrix may be a square matrix whose diagonal elements are all equal to zero. That is, an n × n matrix A = (aij) is hollow if aij = 0 whenever i = j (i.e. aii = 0 for all i). The most obvious example is the real skew-symmetric matrix.  Other examples are the adjacency matrix of a finite simple graph, and a distance matrix or Euclidean distance matrix.
In other words, any square matrix that takes the form

  
    
      
        
          
            (

                  ∗
                
                
                  ∗

    {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}0&\ast &&\ast &\ast \\\ast &0&&\ast &\ast \\&&\ddots \\\ast &\ast &&0&\ast \\\ast &\ast &&\ast &0\end{pmatrix}}}
  is a hollow matrix, where the symbol 
  
    
      
        ∗
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ast }
   denotes an arbitrary entry.

  is a hollow matrix.

Properties
The trace of a hollow matrix is zero.
If A represents a linear map 
  
    
      
        L
        :
        V
        →
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle L:V\to V}
  with respect to a fixed basis, then it maps each basis vector e into the complement of the span of e. That is, 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        ⟨
        e
        ⟩
        )
        ∩
        ⟨
        e
        ⟩
        =
        ⟨
        0
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(\langle e\rangle )\cap \langle e\rangle =\langle 0\rangle }
   where 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        e
        ⟩
        =
        {
        λ
        e
        :
        λ
        ∈
        F
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle e\rangle =\{\lambda e:\lambda \in F\}}
  .
The Gershgorin circle theorem shows that the moduli of the eigenvalues of a hollow matrix are less or equal to the sum of the moduli of the non-diagonal row entries.
