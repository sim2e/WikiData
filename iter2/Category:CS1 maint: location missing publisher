This is a tracking category for book and encyclopedia citations implemented with {{citation}} templates and for book and encyclopedia citations implemented with {{cite book}} and {{cite encyclopedia}}.  To be included in this category, those templates must include:

|location=, |place=, or |publication-place=
|date= or |year= with a year-value of 1850 onwardsbut must not include:

|publisher=.These constraints attempt to acknowledge that many 'old' books and encyclopediae weren't published in the same way as they would be today.  For those cases where a post 1850 book or encyclopedia does not have a publisher, set |publisher=none to suppress this categorization.
Pages in this category should only be added by Module:Citation/CS1.
Pages with this condition are automatically placed in Category:CS1 maint: location missing publisher.
By default, Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 error messages are visible to all readers and maintenance messages are hidden from all readers.
To display maintenance messages in the rendered article, include the following text in your common CSS page (common.css) or your specific skin's CSS page and (skin.css).
(Note to new editors: those CSS pages are specific to you, and control your view of pages, by adding to your user account's CSS code. If you have not yet created such a page, then clicking one of the .css links above will yield a page that starts "Wikipedia does not have a user page with this exact name." Click the "Start the User:username/filename page" link, paste the text below, save the page, follow the instructions at the bottom of the new page on bypassing your browser's cache, and finally, in order to see the previously hidden maintenance messages, refresh the page you were editing earlier.)

To display hidden-by-default error messages:

Even with this CSS installed, older pages in Wikipedia's cache may not have been updated to show these error messages even though the page is listed in one of the tracking categories. A null edit will resolve that issue.
To hide normally-displayed error messages:

You can personalize the display of these messages (such as changing the color), but you will need to ask someone who knows CSS or at the technical village pump if you do not understand how.
Nota bene: these css rules are not obeyed by Navigation popups. They also do not hide script warning messages in the Preview box that begins with "This is only a preview; your changes have not yet been saved".
