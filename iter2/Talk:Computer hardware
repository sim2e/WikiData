Could the authors of this article include clarifying language as to the distinction between a human and a computer? I am worried about human rights and an interpretation of computers that would include humans, leading to relegating a human's rights to that of a computer. Keeping in mind that wikipedia is commonly referenced as an authoritative source, you could prevent much harm this way.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Lowrekey (talk • contribs) 21:20, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

It has come to my notice that computer can't be seen as a title on wikisource, and most users have to constantly search before finding what they want because there are so many search suggestions when searched on wikisource. This has to be corrected because most users may want to see just little details of the above topic, and will end up getting tired of searching for it, pls this has to be corrected.
