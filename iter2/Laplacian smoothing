Laplacian smoothing is an algorithm to smooth a polygonal mesh. For each vertex in a mesh, a new position is chosen based on local information (such as the position of neighbours) and the vertex is moved there. In the case that a mesh is topologically a rectangular grid (that is, each internal vertex is connected to four neighbours) then this operation produces the Laplacian of the mesh.
More formally, the smoothing operation may be described per-vertex as:

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                x
                ¯
              
            
          
          
            i
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            N
          
        
        
          ∑
          
            j
            =
            1
          
          
            N
          
        
        
          
            
              
                x
                ¯
              
            
          
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}_{i}={\frac {1}{N}}\sum _{j=1}^{N}{\bar {x}}_{j}}
  Where 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
   is the number of adjacent vertices to node 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  , 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                x
                ¯
              
            
          
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}_{j}}
   is the position of the 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  -th adjacent vertex and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                x
                ¯
              
            
          
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}_{i}}
   is the new position for node 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  .
