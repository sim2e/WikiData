The Journal of Cheminformatics is a peer-reviewed open access scientific journal that covers cheminformatics and molecular modelling. It was established in 2009 with David Wild (Indiana University) and Christoph Steinbeck (then at EMBL-EBI) as founding editors-in-chief, and was originally published by Chemistry Central. At the end of 2015, the Chemistry Central brand was retired and its titles, including Journal of Cheminformatics, were merged with the SpringerOpen portfolio of open access journals.As of 2016, the editors-in-chief are Rajarshi Guha (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences) and Egon Willighagen (Maastricht University). The journal has issued a few special issues ("article collections") in 2011 and 2012, covering topics like PubChem3D, the Resource Description Framework, and the International Chemical Identifier.
In June 2021 Willighagen announced his intention to step down at the end of the year, explaining in an open letter that the publisher Springer Nature was not sufficiently FAIR and open. Barbara Zdrazil started as editor in chief in 2022.
