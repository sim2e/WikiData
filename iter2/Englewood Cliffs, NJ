Economy
CNBC, LG North American headquarters, and Unilever North America are headquartered in Englewood Cliffs.LG Electronics held a groundbreaking ceremony on November 14, 2013, to build an environmentally friendly North American headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, having received a favorable legal decision subsequently being appealed based upon building height issues. Protesters have sharply criticized the proposal, arguing that the 143-foot (44 m) height of the building exceeds the borough's 35-foot (11 m) limit and that the height of the building above the tree line will disrupt views of the Palisades.In 2017, Maserati announced it was moving its U.S. headquarters from Englewood Cliffs to the former Walter P.
