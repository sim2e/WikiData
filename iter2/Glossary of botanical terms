This glossary of botanical terms is a list of definitions of terms and concepts relevant to botany and plants in general. Terms of plant morphology are included here as well as at the more specific Glossary of plant morphology and Glossary of leaf morphology. For other related terms, see Glossary of phytopathology, Glossary of lichen terms, and List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names.

ab-
Prefix meaning "position away from".

accrescent
Increasing in size with age, such as a calyx that continues to grow after the corolla has fallen, e.g. in Physalis peruviana.

dorsal
From Latin dorsum, a ridge or the back of an animal. Partly because the term originally referred to animals rather than plants, usage in botany is arbitrary according to context and source. In general "dorsal" refers to "the rear or back or upper surface", but in botanical usage such concepts are not always clearly defined and may be contradictory. For example:facing away from the axis (abaxial) in a lateral organ of an erect plant
facing away from the substrate in any part of an erect plant, for example the upper surface of a more or less horizontal leaf (adaxial) or the upper part of the crown of the plant
facing away from the substrate in a prostrate or climbing plant or floating leaves such as those of Nymphaea.

tuber
Any of many types of specialized vegetative underground storage organs. They accumulate food, water, or in protection from death by fire, drought, or other hard times.

In this they differ from the tuber of a sweet potato, which has no special root-like function. Similarly, corms are not generally regarded as tubers, even though they are underground storage stems. Tubers store food for the plant, and also have important roles in vegetative reproduction. They generally are of two main types: stem tubers form by the swelling of an underground stem growing from a root, or from structures such as underground stolons. Stem tubers generally produce propagative buds at their stem nodes, forming a seasonal perennating organ, e.g. a potato. The main other class is the root tuber, also called tuberoid. They differ from stem tubers in features such as that, like any normal root, they do not form nodes.

vascular
Referring to the conducting tissues (xylem and phloem) of vascular plants.

vascular bundle

velvety
Densely covered with fine, short, soft, erect hairs.

venation
The arrangement of veins in a leaf.

ventral
From Latin venter, meaning "belly". The opposite of dorsal. Partly because the term originally referred to animals rather than plants, usage in botany is arbitrary according to context and source. In general "ventral" refers to "the belly or lower part", but in botanical usage such concepts are not always clearly defined and may be contradictory. For example:facing toward the axis (adaxial) in referring to a lateral organ of an erect plant
facing toward the substrate in any part of an erect plant, for example the lower surface of a more or less horizontal leaf (abaxial)
facing toward the substrate in a prostrate or climbing plant.
For more detail see dorsal.

versatile
(of anthers) Swinging freely about the point of attachment to the filament.

verticillate
Arranged in one or more whorls, i.e. several similar parts arranged at the same point of the axis, e.g. leaf arrangement. Compare pseudoverticillate (appearing whorled or verticillate but not actually so).

verticillaster
A type of pseudoverticillate inflorescence, typical of the Lamiaceae, in which pseudo-whorls are formed from pairs of opposite cymes.

vesicular
(of hairs) Bladder-like; vesciculous, bearing such hairs.

vessel
A capillary tube formed from a series of open-ended cells in the water-conducting tissue of a plant.

whorl
A ring of organs borne at the same level on an axis (e.g. leaves, bracts, or floral parts).

wing
1.  A membranous expansion of a fruit or seed which aids in dispersal, for instance on pine seeds.
2.  A thin flange of tissue extending beyond the normal outline of a structure, e.g. on the column of some orchids, on stems, on petioles.
