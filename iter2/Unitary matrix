In linear algebra, an invertible complex square matrix U is unitary if its conjugate transpose U* is also its inverse, that is, if

where I is the identity matrix.
In physics, especially in quantum mechanics, the conjugate transpose is referred to as the Hermitian adjoint of a matrix and is denoted by a dagger (†), so the equation above is written

For real numbers, the analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix. Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms, and thus, probability amplitudes.

Properties
For any unitary matrix U of finite size, the following hold:

Given two complex vectors x and y, multiplication by U preserves their inner product; that is, ⟨Ux, Uy⟩ = ⟨x, y⟩.
U is normal (
  
    
      
        
          U
          
            ∗
          
        
        U
        =
        U
        
          U
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U^{*}U=UU^{*}}
  ).
U is diagonalizable; that is, U is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, as a consequence of the spectral theorem. Thus, U has a decomposition of the form 
  
    
      
        U
        =
        V
        D
        
          V
          
            ∗
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle U=VDV^{*},}
   where V is unitary, and D is diagonal and unitary.

        U
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \det(U)}
   will be on the unit circle of the complex plane.
Its eigenspaces are orthogonal.
U can be written as U = eiH, where e indicates the matrix exponential, i is the imaginary unit, and H is a Hermitian matrix.For any nonnegative integer n, the set of all n × n unitary matrices with matrix multiplication forms a group, called the unitary group U(n).
Any square matrix with unit Euclidean norm is the average of two unitary matrices.

If U is a square, complex matrix, then the following conditions are equivalent:

Elementary constructions
2 × 2 unitary matrix
One general expression of a 2 × 2 unitary matrix is

which depends on 4 real parameters (the phase of a, the phase of b, the relative magnitude between a and b, and the angle φ). The form is configured so the determinant of such a matrix is

The sub-group of those elements 
  
    
      
         
        U
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ U\ }
   with 
  
    
      
         
        det
        (
        U
        )
        =
        1
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \det(U)=1\ }
   is called the special unitary group SU(2).
Among several alternative forms, the matrix U can be written in this form:

where 
  
    
      
         
        
          e
          
            i
            α
          
        
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
        =
        a
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ e^{i\alpha }\cos \theta =a\ }
   and 
  
    
      
         
        
          e
          
            i
            β
          
        
        sin
        ⁡
        θ
        =
        b
         
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ e^{i\beta }\sin \theta =b\ ,}
   above, and the angles 
  
    
      
         
        φ
        ,
        α
        ,
        β
        ,
        θ
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \varphi ,\alpha ,\beta ,\theta \ }
   can take any values.
By introducing 
  
    
      
         
        α
        =
        ψ
        +
        δ
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \alpha =\psi +\delta \ }
   and 
  
    
      
         
        β
        =
        ψ
        −
        δ
         
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \beta =\psi -\delta \ ,}
   has the following factorization:

This expression highlights the relation between 2 × 2 unitary matrices and 2 × 2 orthogonal matrices of angle θ.
Another factorization is
Many other factorizations of a unitary matrix in basic matrices are possible.
