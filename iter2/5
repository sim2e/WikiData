5 (five) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number, and cardinal number, following 4 and preceding 6, and is a prime number. It has garnered attention throughout history in part because distal extremities in humans typically contain five digits.

Evolution of the Arabic digit
The evolution of the modern Western digit for the numeral 5 cannot be traced back to the Indian system, as for the digits 1 to 4. The Kushana and Gupta empires in what is now India had among themselves several forms that bear no resemblance to the modern digit. The Nagari and Punjabi took these digits and all came up with forms that were similar to a lowercase "h" rotated 180°. The Ghubar Arabs transformed the digit in several ways, producing from that were more similar to the digits 4 or 3 than to 5. It was from those digits that Europeans finally came up with the modern 5.

While the shape of the character for the digit 5 has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the glyph usually has a descender, as, for example, in .
On the seven-segment display of a calculator and digital clock, it is represented by five segments at four successive turns from top to bottom, rotating counterclockwise first, then clockwise, and vice-versa. It is one of three numbers, along with 4 and 6, where the number of segments matches the number.

Mathematics
Five is the third-smallest prime number, and the second super-prime. It is the first safe prime, the first good prime, the first balanced prime, and the first of three known Wilson primes. Five is the second Fermat prime, the second Proth prime, and the third Mersenne prime exponent, as well as the third Catalan number and the third Sophie Germain prime. Notably, 5 is equal to the sum of the only consecutive primes 2 + 3 and it is the only number that is part of more than one pair of twin primes, (3, 5) and (5, 7). It also forms the first pair of sexy primes with 11, which is the fifth prime number and Heegner number, as well as the first repunit prime in decimal; a base in-which five is also the first non-trivial 1-automorphic number. Five is the third factorial prime, and an alternating factorial. It is also an Eisenstein prime (like 11) with no imaginary part and real part of the form

  . In particular, five is the first congruent number, since it is the length of the hypotenuse of the smallest integer-sided right triangle.

Number theory
5 is the fifth Fibonacci number, being 2 plus 3, and the only Fibonacci number that is equal to its position aside from 1 (that is also the second index). Five is also a Pell number and a Markov number, appearing in solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation: (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 13), (2, 5, 29), (5, 13, 194), (5, 29, 433), ... (OEIS: A030452 lists Markov numbers that appear in solutions where one of the other two terms is 5). In the Perrin sequence 5 is both the fifth and sixth Perrin numbers.5 is the second Fermat prime of the form

  . There are a total of five known Fermat primes, which also include 3, 17, 257, and 65537. The sum of the first three Fermat primes, 3, 5 and 17, yields 25 or 52, while 257 is the 55th prime number. Combinations from these five Fermat primes generate thirty-one polygons with an odd number of sides that can be constructed purely with a compass and straight-edge, which includes the five-sided regular pentagon.: pp.137–142  Apropos, thirty-one is also equal to the sum of the maximum number of areas inside a circle that are formed from the sides and diagonals of the first five

There are a total of five known unitary perfect numbers, which are numbers that are the sums of their positive proper unitary divisors. The smallest such number is 6, and the largest of these is equivalent to the sum of 4095 divisors, where 4095 is the largest of five Ramanujan–Nagell numbers that are both triangular numbers and Mersenne numbers of the general form. The sums of the first five non-primes greater than zero 1 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 and the first five prime numbers 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 both equal 28; the seventh triangular number and like 6 a perfect number, which also includes 496, the thirty-first triangular number and perfect number of the form

Within the larger family of Ore numbers, 140 and 496, respectively the fourth and sixth indexed members, both contain a set of divisors that produce integer harmonic means equal to 5. The fifth Mersenne prime, 8191, splits into 4095 and 4096, with the latter being the fifth superperfect number and the sixth power of four, 46.

Figurate numbers and magic figures
In figurate numbers, 5 is a pentagonal number, with the sequence of pentagonal numbers starting: 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...

  , where 125 is the second number to have an aliquot sum of 31 (after the fifth power of two, 32). 
On its own, 31 is the first prime centered pentagonal number, and the fifth centered triangular number. Collectively, five and thirty-one generate a sum of 36 (the square of 6) and a difference of 26, which is the only number to lie between a square

In the sequence of pentatope numbers that start from the first (or fifth) cell of the fifth row of Pascal's triangle (left to right or from right to left), the first few terms are: 1, 5, 15, 35, 70, 126, 210, 330, 495, ... The first five members in this sequence add to 126, which is also the sixth pentagonal pyramidal number as well as the fifth

Fifty-five is also the tenth Fibonacci number, whose digit sum is also 10, in its decimal representation. It is the tenth triangular number and the fourth that is doubly triangular, the fifth heptagonal number and fourth centered nonagonal number, and as listed above, the fifth square pyramidal number.

In base-ten, 15 and 27 are the only two-digit numbers that are equal to the sum between their digits (inclusive, i.e. 2 + 3 + ... + 7 = 27), with these two numbers consecutive perfect totient numbers after 3 and 9. 103 is the fifth irregular prime that divides the numerator (236364091) of the twenty-fourth Bernoulli number

  , and as such it is part of the eighth irregular pair (103, 24). In a two-dimensional array, the number of planar partitions with a sum of four is equal to thirteen and the number of such partitions with a sum of five is twenty-four, a value equal to the sum-of-divisors of the ninth arithmetic number 15 whose divisors also produce an integer arithmetic mean of 6 (alongside an aliquot sum of 9). The smallest value that the magic constant of a five-pointed magic pentagram can have using distinct integers is 24.

Collatz conjecture
In the Collatz 3x + 1 problem, 5 requires five steps to reach one by multiplying terms by three and adding one if the term is odd (starting with five itself), and dividing by two if they are even: {5 ➙ 16 ➙ 8 ➙ 4 ➙ 2 ➙ 1}; the only other number to require five steps is 32 since 16 must be part of such path (see  for a map of orbits for small odd numbers).Specifically, 120 needs fifteen steps to arrive at 5: {120 ➙ 60 ➙ 30 ➙ 15 ➙ 46 ➙ 23 ➙ 70 ➙ 35 ➙ 106 ➙ 53 ➙ 160 ➙ 80 ➙ 40 ➙ 20 ➙ 10 ➙ 5}. These comprise a total of sixteen numbers before cycling through {16 ➙ 8 ➙ 4 ➙ 2 ➙ 1}, where 16 is the smallest number with exactly five divisors, and one of only two numbers to have an aliquot sum of 15, after 33. On the other hand, the trajectory of 15 requires seventeen steps to reach 1, where its reduced Collatz trajectory is equal to five when counting the steps {23, 35, 53, 5, 1} that are prime, including 1. Overall, thirteen numbers in the Collatz map for 15 back to 1 are composite, where the largest prime in the trajectory of 120 back to {4 ➙ 2 ➙ 1 ➙ 4 ➙ ...} is the sixteenth prime number, 53.When generalizing the Collatz conjecture to all positive or negative integers, −5 becomes one of only four known possible cycle starting points and endpoints, and in its case in five steps too: {−5 ➙ −14 ➙ −7 ➙ −20 ➙ −10 ➙ −5 ➙ ...}. The other possible cycles begin and end at −17 in eighteen steps, −1 in two steps, and 1 in three steps. This behavior is analogous to the path cycle of five in the 3x − 1 problem, where 5 takes five steps to return cyclically, in this instance by multiplying terms by three and subtracting 1 if the terms are odd, and also halving if even. It is also the first number to generate a cycle that is not trivial (i.e. 1 ➙ 2 ➙ 1 ➙ ...).

Generalizations
Five is conjectured to be the only odd untouchable number, and if this is the case then five will be the only odd prime number that is not the base of an aliquot tree. Meanwhile:

  , is only power-associative, and is the first algebra to contain non-trivial zero divisors as with all further algebras over larger fields. Altogether, these five algebras operate, respectively, over fields of dimension 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.

Geometry
A pentagram, or five-pointed polygram, is the first proper star polygon constructed from the diagonals of a regular pentagon as self-intersecting edges that are proportioned in golden ratio, 
  
    
      
        φ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varphi }
  . Its internal geometry appears prominently in Penrose tilings, and is a facet inside Kepler-Poinsot star polyhedra and Schläfli–Hess star polychora, represented by its Schläfli symbol {5/2}. A similar figure to the pentagram is a five-pointed simple isotoxal star ☆ without self-intersecting edges. It is often found as a facet inside Islamic Girih tiles, of which there are five different rudimentary types. Generally, star polytopes that are regular only exist in dimensions

  , and can be constructed using five Miller rules for stellating polyhedra or higher-dimensional polytopes.

Graphs theory, and planar geometry
In graph theory, all graphs with four or fewer vertices are planar, however, there is a graph with five vertices that is not: K5, the complete graph with five vertices, where every pair of distinct vertices in a pentagon is joined by unique edges belonging to a pentagram. By Kuratowski's theorem, a finite graph is planar iff it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5, or the complete bipartite utility graph K3,3. A similar graph is the Petersen graph, which is strongly connected and also nonplanar. It is most easily described as graph of a pentagram embedded inside a pentagon, with a total of 5 crossings, a girth of 5, and a Thue number of 5. The Petersen graph, which is also a distance-regular graph, is one of only 5 known connected vertex-transitive graphs with no Hamiltonian cycles. The automorphism group of the Petersen graph is the symmetric group 
  
    
      
        
          
            S

    {\displaystyle \mathrm {S} _{5}}
   of order 120 = 5!.
The chromatic number of the plane is at least five, depending on the choice of set-theoretical axioms: the minimum number of colors required to color the plane such that no pair of points at a distance of 1 has the same color. Whereas the hexagonal Golomb graph and the regular hexagonal tiling generate chromatic numbers of 4 and 7, respectively, a chromatic coloring of 5 can be attained under a more complicated graph where multiple four-coloring Moser spindles are linked so that no monochromatic triples exist in any coloring of the overall graph, as that would generate an equilateral arrangement that tends toward a purely hexagonal structure.
The plane also contains a total of five Bravais lattices, or arrays of points defined by discrete translation operations: hexagonal, oblique, rectangular, centered rectangular, and square lattices. Uniform tilings of the plane, furthermore, are generated from combinations of only five regular polygons: the triangle, square, hexagon, octagon, and the dodecagon. The plane can also be tiled monohedrally with convex pentagons in fifteen different ways, three of which have Laves tilings as special cases.

Polyhedra
There are five Platonic solids in three-dimensional space that are regular: the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. The dodecahedron in particular contains pentagonal faces, while the icosahedron, its dual polyhedron, has a vertex figure that is a regular pentagon. These five regular solids are responsible for generating thirteen figures that classify as semi-regular, which are called the Archimedean solids. There are also five:

Moreover, the fifth pentagonal pyramidal number 
  
    
      
        75
        =
        15
        ×
        5
      
    
    {\displaystyle 75=15\times 5}
   represents the total number of indexed uniform compound polyhedra, which includes seven families of prisms and antiprisms. Seventy-five is also the number of non-prismatic uniform polyhedra, which includes Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, and star polyhedra; there are also precisely five uniform prisms and antiprisms that contain pentagons or pentagrams as faces — the pentagonal prism and antiprism, and the pentagrammic prism, antiprism, and crossed-antirprism. In all, there are twenty-five uniform polyhedra that generate four-dimensional uniform polychora, they are the five Platonic solids, fifteen Archimedean solids counting two enantiomorphic forms, and five associated prisms: the triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, and decagonal prisms.

Fourth dimension
The pentatope, or 5-cell, is the self-dual fourth-dimensional analogue of the tetrahedron, with Coxeter group symmetry

It is one of six regular 4-polytopes, made of thirty-one elements: five vertices, ten edges, ten faces, five tetrahedral cells and one 4-face.: p.120 

Overall, the fourth dimension contains five fundamental Weyl groups that form a finite number of uniform polychora based on only twenty-five uniform polyhedra:

  , accompanied by a fifth or sixth general group of unique 4-prisms of Platonic and Archimedean solids. There are also a total of five Coxeter groups that generate non-prismatic Euclidean honeycombs in 4-space, alongside five compact hyperbolic Coxeter groups that generate five regular compact hyperbolic honeycombs with finite facets, as with the order-5 5-cell honeycomb and the order-5 120-cell honeycomb, both of which have five cells around each face. Compact hyperbolic honeycombs only exist through the fourth dimension, or rank 5, with paracompact hyperbolic solutions existing through rank 10.

List of basic calculations
In decimal
All multiples of 5 will end in either 5 or 0, and vulgar fractions with 5 or 2 in the denominator do not yield infinite decimal expansions because they are prime factors of 10, the base.
In the powers of 5, every power ends with the number five, and from 53 onward, if the exponent is odd, then the hundreds digit is 1, and if it is even, the hundreds digit is 6.
A number 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   raised to the fifth power always ends in the same digit as

Judaism
The Torah contains five books—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy—which are collectively called the Five Books of Moses, the Pentateuch (Greek for "five containers", referring to the scroll cases in which the books were kept), or Humash (חומש, Hebrew for "fifth").
The book of Psalms is arranged into five books, paralleling the Five Books of Moses.

Sikhism
The five sacred Sikh symbols prescribed by Guru Gobind Singh are commonly known as panj kakars or the "Five Ks" because they start with letter K representing kakka (ਕ) in the Punjabi language's Gurmukhi script. They are: kesh (unshorn hair), kangha (the comb), kara (the steel bracelet), kachhehra (the soldier's shorts), and kirpan (the sword) (in Gurmukhi: ਕੇਸ, ਕੰਘਾ, ਕੜਾ, ਕਛਹਰਾ, ਕਿਰਪਾਨ). Also, there are five deadly evils: kam (lust), krodh (anger), moh (attachment), lobh (greed), and ankhar (ego).
