The relative strength of two systems of formal logic can be defined via model theory. Specifically, a logic 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   is said to be as strong as a logic 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
   if every elementary class in 
  
    
      
        β
      
    
    {\displaystyle \beta }
   is an elementary class in  
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  .
