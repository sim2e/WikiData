With the decreased cost and increased capabilities of computers, Nuclear Engineering has implemented computer software (Computer code to Mathematical model) into all facets of this field. There are a wide variety of fields associated with nuclear engineering, but computers and associated software are used most often in design and analysis. Neutron Kinetics, Thermal-hydraulics, and structural mechanics are all important in this effort. each software need to test and verify before use. The codes can be separated by use and function. most of software's written in C and Fortran.
