This is a list of axioms as that term is understood in mathematics. In epistemology, the word axiom is understood differently; see axiom and self-evidence. Individual axioms are almost always part of a larger axiomatic system.

ZF (the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the axiom of choice)
Together with the axiom of choice (see below), these are the de facto standard axioms for contemporary mathematics or set theory. They can be easily adapted to analogous theories, such as mereology.

Axiom of extensionality
Axiom of empty set
Axiom of pairing
Axiom of union
Axiom of infinity
Axiom schema of replacement
Axiom of power set
Axiom of regularity
Axiom schema of specificationSee also Zermelo set theory.

Axiom of choice
With the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms above, this makes up the system ZFC in which most mathematics is potentially formalisable.
