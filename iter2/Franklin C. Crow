Franklin C. (Frank) Crow is a computer scientist who has made important contributions to computer graphics, including some of the first practical spatial anti-aliasing techniques.  Crow also proposed the shadow volume technique for generating geometrically accurate shadows.

Education
Crow studied electrical engineering at the University of Utah College of Engineering under Ivan Sutherland, a pioneer in computer graphics.

Career
Crow taught at the University of Texas, NYIT and Ohio State University and was involved with research at Xerox PARC, Apple Computer's Advanced Technology Group, and Interval Research.From 2001 to 2008, he worked for NVIDIA as a GPU architect designing rasterization algorithms.
