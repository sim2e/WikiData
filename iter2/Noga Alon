Noga Alon (Hebrew: נוגה אלון; born 1956) is an Israeli mathematician and a professor of mathematics at Princeton University noted for his contributions to combinatorics and theoretical computer science, having authored hundreds of papers.

Education and career
Alon was born in 1956 in Haifa, where he graduated from the Hebrew Reali School in 1974. He graduated summa cum laude from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology in 1979, earned a master's degree in mathematics in 1980 from Tel Aviv University, and received his Ph.D. in Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1983 with the dissertation Extremal Problems in Combinatorics supervised by Micha Perles.After postdoctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology he returned to Tel Aviv University as a senior lecturer in 1985, obtained a permanent position as an associate professor there in 1986, and was promoted to full professor in 1988. He was head of the School of Mathematical Science from 1999 to 2001, and was given the Florence and Ted Baumritter Combinatorics and Computer Science Chair, before retiring as professor emeritus and moving to Princeton University in 2018.He was editor-in-chief of the journal Random Structures and Algorithms beginning in 2008.

Research
Alon has published more than five hundred research papers, mostly in combinatorics and in theoretical computer science, and one book, on the probabilistic method. He has also published under the pseudonym "A. Nilli", based on the name of his daughter Nilli Alon.His research contributions include the combinatorial Nullstellensatz, an algebraic tool with many applications in combinatorics; color-coding, a technique for fixed-parameter tractability of pattern-matching algorithms in graphs; and the Alon–Boppana bound in spectral graph theory.
