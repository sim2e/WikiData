10 (ten) is the even natural number following 9 and preceding 11. Ten is the base of the decimal numeral system, the most common system of denoting numbers in both spoken and written language.

Anthropology
Usage and terms
A collection of ten items (most often ten years) is called a decade.
The ordinal adjective is decimal; the distributive adjective is denary.
Increasing a quantity by one order of magnitude is most widely understood to mean multiplying the quantity by ten.
To reduce something by one tenth is to decimate. (In ancient Rome, the killing of one in ten soldiers in a cohort was the punishment for cowardice or mutiny; or, one-tenth of the able-bodied men in a village as a form of retribution, thus causing a labor shortage and threat of starvation in agrarian societies.)

In mathematics
Ten is the fifth composite number, and the smallest noncototient, which is a number that cannot be expressed as the difference between any integer and the total number of coprimes below it. Ten is the eighth Perrin number, preceded by 5, 5, and 7.As important sums,

The smallest integer with exactly ten divisors is 48, while the least integer with exactly eleven divisors is 1024, which sets a new record.Figurate numbers that represent regular ten-sided polygons are called decagonal and centered decagonal numbers. On the other hand, 10 is the first non-trivial centered triangular number and tetrahedral number.
While 55 is the tenth triangular number, it is also the tenth Fibonacci number, and the largest such number to also be a triangular number.A

   that are associated with simplex, cubic and demihypercubic honeycombs, or tessellations. Regarding Coxeter groups in hyperbolic space, there are infinitely many such groups; however, ten is the highest rank for paracompact hyperbolic solutions, with a representation in nine dimensions. There also exist hyperbolic Lorentzian cocompact groups where removing any permutation of two nodes in its Coxeter–Dynkin diagram leaves a finite or Euclidean graph. The tenth dimension is the highest dimensional representation for such solutions, which share a root symmetry in eleven dimensions. These are of particular interest in M-theory of string theory.

In science
The SI prefix for 10 is "deca-".
The meaning "10" is part of the following terms:

decapoda, an order of crustaceans with ten feet.
decane, a hydrocarbon with 10 carbon atoms.Also, the number 10 plays a role in the following: 

The atomic number of neon.
The number of hydrogen atoms in butane, a hydrocarbon.
The number of spacetime dimensions in some superstring theories.The metric system is based on the number 10, so converting units is done by adding or removing zeros (e.g. 1 centimeter = 10 millimeters, 1 decimeter = 10 centimeters, 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 1 dekameter = 10 meters, 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters).

In religion and philosophy
References in the Bible and the Quran, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam:
The Ten Commandments of Exodus and Deuteronomy are considered a cornerstone of Judaism and Christianity.
People traditionally tithed one-tenth of their produce. The practice of tithing is still common in Christian churches today, though it is disputed in some circles as to whether or not it is required of Christians.
In Deuteronomy 26:12, the Torah commands Jews to give one-tenth of their produce to the poor (Maaser Ani). From this verse and from an earlier verse (Deut. 14:22) there derives a practice for Jews to give one-tenth of all earnings to the poor.
Ten Plagues were inflicted on Egypt in Exodus 7–12.
Jews observe the annual Ten Days of Repentance beginning on Rosh Hashanah and ending on Yom Kippur.
In Jewish liturgy, Ten Martyrs are singled out as a group.
There are said to be Ten Lost Tribes of Israel (those other than Judah and Benjamin).
There are Ten Sephirot in the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.
In Judaism, ten men are the required quorum, called a minyan, for prayer services.
In Genesis 18:23-32, Abraham pleads on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah, asking to save the cities if there are enough righteous people there. He starts at 10 per city, and ends with 10 total in all cities.
Interpretations of Genesis in Talmudic and Midrashic teachings suggest that on the first day, God drew forth ten primal elements from the abyss in order to construct all of Creation: Heaven (or Fire), Earth, Chaos, Void, Light, Darkness, Wind (or Spirit), Water, Day, and Night. See also Bereshit (parsha).
Jesus tells the Parable of the Ten Virgins in Matthew 25:1–13.Complete the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage for Allah.1 But if prevented ˹from proceeding˺, then ˹offer˺ whatever sacrificial animals you can afford. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches its destination. But if any of you is ill or has a scalp ailment ˹requiring shaving˺, then compensate either by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering. In times of peace, you may combine the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage then make the sacrificial offering you can afford. Whoever cannot afford that ˹offering˺, let them fast three days during pilgrimage and seven after returning ˹home˺—completing ten. These offerings are for those who do not live near the Sacred House. And be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.
Note 1: Ḥajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, is required at least once in a Muslim’s lifetime if they are physically and financially able to. Umrah, which is a short version of ḥajj, is recommended, but not obligatory.Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful.
In Pythagoreanism, the number 10 played an important role and was symbolized by the tetractys.
In Hinduism, Lord Vishnu appeared on the earth in 10 incarnations, popularly known as Dashaavathar.
In Sikhism, there are ten human Gurus.

In money
Most countries issue coins and bills with a denomination of 10 (See e.g. 10 dollar note). Of these, the U.S. dime, with the value of ten cents, or one tenth of a dollar, derives its name from the meaning "one-tenth" − see Dime (United States coin)#Denomination history and etymology.
