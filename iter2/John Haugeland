Philosophical work
In Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea, Haugeland coined the term GOFAI ("Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence"): 112  for symbolic artificial intelligence.
In Having Thought, he gathered together some of his most influential papers, thirteen, ordered both chronologically and also thematically, under a number of subject headings, namely mind, matter, meaning and truth. Subject heading mind elaborates about cognitive science, with a couple of papers, and about Hume with a third one. Subject heading matter addresses, through three papers, the relation between the intelligibility of mind and the material or physical. Meaning musters diverse papers all about the relationship between us and the world and, finally, truth deals, by means of four papers, with objectivity in terms of constitution as grounded in commitment.: 3–6 Philosophers who completed their doctoral dissertations under John Haugeland's supervision include Danielle Macbeth, Tim van Gelder, Quill Kukla, and Zed Adams.
