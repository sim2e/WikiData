I don't want to remove the group because I didn't contribute anything to the template and removing stuff added by other users seems rude to me. But now using JS or GO for programming gradient descent based algorithm is not that uncommon, does it implies that wikipedia should also add JS/GO to the group. To put it simply, I don't think having a group for popular programming languages used for Differentiable computing helps anyone but rather might push the idea that Python is the language for AI ignoring many other important stuff, for example the C++ core of the python interface. I don't hate python/julia and not a Go/JS fanboy. -- 1e100 (talk) 11:16, 18 December 2021 (UTC)

I agree, any language could in principle be used for differential computing, it's kind of silly to single out specific languages to list here DinoInNameOnly (talk) 23:53, 31 August 2022 (UTC)
+1: This should be removed. Stellaathena (talk) 16:01, 15 March 2023 (UTC)
As far as I can tell, the "Implementation" grouping is most similar what AI researchers refer to as "modality." However there are a few notable deviations from that:
1. Audio and Visual modalities are typically treated separately.
2. AlphaFold is really it's own modality ("biomedical structure")
3. It is typical to consider multimodal models such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion as their own category distinct from unimodal image models
4. "Verbal" is typically referred to as "text," as most NLP research focuses on text data rather than spoken data
