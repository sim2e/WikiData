In mathematics and especially in combinatorics, a plane partition is a two-dimensional array of nonnegative integers 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{i,j}}
   (with positive integer indices i and j) that is nonincreasing in both indices. This means that

  
    
      
        
          π
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
        ≥
        
          π
          
            i
            ,
            j
            +
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{i,j}\geq \pi _{i,j+1}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
        ≥
        
          π
          
            i
            +
            1
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{i,j}\geq \pi _{i+1,j}}
   for all i and j.Moreover, only finitely many of the 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{i,j}}
   may be nonzero.  Plane partitions are a generalization of partitions of an integer.
A plane partition may be represented visually by the placement of a stack of 
  
    
      
        
          π
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi _{i,j}}
   unit cubes above the point (i, j) in the plane, giving a three-dimensional solid as shown in the picture. The image has matrix form

  
    
      
        
          
            
              
                4
              
              
                4
              
              
                3
              
              
                2
              
              
                1
              
            
            
              
                4
              
              
                3
              
              
                1
              
              
                1

                1
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}4&4&3&2&1\\4&3&1&1\\3&2&1\\1\end{matrix}}}
  Plane partitions are also often described by the positions of the unit cubes. From this point of view, a plane partition can be defined as a finite subset 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}
   of positive integer lattice points (i, j, k) in 
  
    
      
        
          
            N
          
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} ^{3}}
  , such that if (r, s, t) lies in 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}
   and if 
  
    
      
        (
        i
        ,
        j
        ,
        k
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (i,j,k)}
   satisfies 
  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        i
        ≤
        r
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq i\leq r}
  , 
  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        j
        ≤
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq j\leq s}
  , and 
  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        k
        ≤
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq k\leq t}
  , then (i, j, k) also lies in 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}
  .
The sum of a plane partition is

  
    
      
        n
        =
        
          ∑
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
        
          π
          
            i
            ,
            j
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=\sum _{i,j}\pi _{i,j}.}
  The sum describes the number of cubes of which the plane partition consists.  Much interest in plane partitions concerns the enumeration of plane partitions in various classes.  The number of plane partitions with sum n is denoted by PL(n).  For example, there are six plane partitions with sum 3

                1
              
              
                1

                2
              
            
            
              
                1
              
            
          
        
        
        
          
            
              
                1
              
              
                1
              
            
            
              
                1
              
            
          
        
        
        
          
            
              
                1
              
            
            
              
                1
              
            
            
              
                1
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}3\end{matrix}}\qquad {\begin{matrix}2&1\end{matrix}}\qquad {\begin{matrix}1&1&1\end{matrix}}\qquad {\begin{matrix}2\\1\end{matrix}}\qquad {\begin{matrix}1&1\\1\end{matrix}}\qquad {\begin{matrix}1\\1\\1\end{matrix}}}
  so PL(3) = 6.
Plane partitions may be classified by how symmetric they are.  Many symmetric classes of plane partitions are enumerated by simple product formulas.

  (sequence A000219 in the OEIS).It is sometimes referred to as the MacMahon function, as it was discovered by Percy A. MacMahon.
This formula may be viewed as the 2-dimensional analogue of Euler's product formula for the number of integer partitions of n. There is no analogous formula known for partitions in higher dimensions (i.e., for solid partitions). The asymptotics for plane partitions were first calculated by E. M. Wright. One obtains, for large

Special plane partitions
Special plane partitions include symmetric, cyclic and self-complementary plane partitions, and combinations of these properties.
In the subsequent sections, the enumeration of special sub-classes of plane partitions inside a box are considered.
These articles use the notation

The height increases by one for each step away from the back right corner. For example, the corner position (1, 1, 1) has height 1 and ht(2, 1, 1) = 2.  The height of an orbit is defined to be the height of any element in the orbit. This notation of the height differs from the notation of Ian G. Macdonald.There is a natural action of the permutation group

Symmetric plane partitions
A plane partition 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   is called symmetric if πi,j = πj,i for all i, j. In other words, a plane partition is symmetric if 
  
    
      
        (
        i
        ,
        j
        ,
        k
        )
        ∈
        
          
            B

        r
        ,
        s
        ,
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (i,j,k)\in {\mathcal {B}}(r,s,t)}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        (
        j
        ,
        i
        ,
        k
        )
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
        (
        r
        ,

        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (j,i,k)\in {\mathcal {B}}(r,s,t)}

  In 1972 Edward A. Bender and Donald E. Knuth conjectured a simple closed form for the generating function for plane partition which have at most r rows and strict decrease along the rows. George Andrews showed that the conjecture of Bender and Knuth and the MacMahon conjecture are equivalent. MacMahon's conjecture was proven almost simultaneously by George Andrews in 1977 and later Ian G. Macdonald presented an alternative proof.

Cyclically symmetric plane partitions
π is called cyclically symmetric, if the i-th row of 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   is conjugate to the i-th column for all i. The i-th row is regarded as an ordinary partition. The conjugate of a partition 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   is the partition whose diagram is the transpose of partition 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
  . In other words, the plane partition is cyclically symmetric if whenever 
  
    
      
        (
        i
        ,
        j
        ,

        r
        ,
        s
        ,
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (i,j,k)\in {\mathcal {B}}(r,s,t)}
   then (k, i, j) and (j, k, i) also belong to 
  
    
      
        
          
            B

Around 1983 Andrews and Robbins independently stated an explicit product formula for the orbit-counting generating function for totally symmetric plane partitions. This formula already alluded to in George E. Andrews' paper Totally symmetric plane partitions which was published 1980. The conjecture is called The q-TSPP conjecture and it is given by:
Let

  . According to Stanley, Robbins also formulated formulas for the total number of self-complementary plane partitions in a different but equivalent form. The total number of self-complementary plane partitions that are subsets of

  It is necessary that the product of r,s and t is even. A proof can be found in the paper Symmetries of Plane Partitions which was written by Stanley. The proof works with Schur functions

        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{s^{r}}(x)}
  . Stanley's proof of the ordinary enumeration of self-complementary plane partitions yields the q-analogue by substituting

    {\displaystyle i=1,\ldots ,n}
  . This is a special case of Stanley's hook-content formula. The generating function for self-complementary plane partitions is given by

Cyclically symmetric self-complementary plane partitions
A plane partition 
  
    
      
        π
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pi }
   is called cyclically symmetric self-complementary if it is cyclically symmetric and self-complementary. The figure presents a cyclically symmetric self-complementary plane partition and the according matrix is below.
