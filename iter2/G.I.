G.I. is an informal term that refers to "a soldier in the United States armed forces, especially the army" It is mostly deeply associated with World War II, but continues to see use.It was originally an acronym used in U.S. Army paperwork for items made of galvanized iron. The earliest known instance in writing is from either 1906 or 1907.During World War I, US soldiers took to referring to heavy German artillery shells as "G.I. cans". During the same war, "G.I." (reinterpreted as "government issue" or "general issue") started to be used to refer to any item associated with the US Army (e.g. "G.I. soap"). Other reinterpretations of "G.I." include "garrison issue" and "general infantry".The earliest known recorded instances of "G.I." being used to refer to an American enlisted man (as a slang term) are from 1935. In the form of "G.I. Joe" it was made better known due to it being taken as the title of a comic strip by Dave Breger in Yank, the Army Weekly starting in 1942."G.I. Jane" originally referred to a member of the Women's Army Corps during World War II but more recently it is used to refer to any female American soldier.In British military parlance and in armed forces modelled on British military traditions, G.I. refers to a Gunnery Instructor (generally an NCO responsible for inducting and training recruits).
