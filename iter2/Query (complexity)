In descriptive complexity, a query is a mapping from structures of one signature to structures of another vocabulary.  Neil Immerman, in his book Descriptive Complexity, "use[s] the concept of query as the fundamental paradigm of computation" (p. 17).
Given signatures 
  
    
      
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma }
   and 
  
    
      
        τ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \tau }
  , we define the set of structures on each language, 
  
    
      
        
          
            STRUC
          
        
        [
        σ
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mbox{STRUC}}[\sigma ]}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            STRUC
          
        
        [
        τ
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mbox{STRUC}}[\tau ]}
  .  A query is then any mapping

  
    
      
        I
        :
        
          
            STRUC
          
        
        [
        σ
        ]
        →
        
          
            STRUC
          
        
        [
        τ
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle I:{\mbox{STRUC}}[\sigma ]\to {\mbox{STRUC}}[\tau ]}
  

Computational complexity theory can then be phrased in terms of the power of the mathematical logic necessary to express a given query.

Order-independent queries
A query is order-independent if the ordering of objects in the structure does not affect the results of the query.  In databases, these queries correspond to generic queries (Immerman 1999, p. 18).  A query is order-independent iff 
  
    
      
        I
        (
        
          
            A
          
        
        )
        ≡
        I
        (
        
          
            B
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle I({\mathfrak {A}})\equiv I({\mathfrak {B}})}
   for any isomorphic structures 
  
    
      
        
          
            A
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {B}}}
  .
