Channel capacity, in electrical engineering, computer science, and information theory, is the tight upper bound on the rate at which information can be reliably transmitted over a communication channel.
Following the terms of the noisy-channel coding theorem, the channel capacity of a given channel is the highest information rate (in units of information per unit time) that can be achieved with arbitrarily small error probability.Information theory, developed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948, defines the notion of channel capacity and provides a mathematical model by which it may be computed. The key result states that the capacity of the channel, as defined above, is given by the maximum of the mutual information between the input and output of the channel, where the maximization is with respect to the input distribution.The notion of channel capacity has been central to the development of modern wireline and wireless communication systems, with the advent of novel error correction coding mechanisms that have resulted in achieving performance very close to the limits promised by channel capacity.

Formal definition

Additivity of channel capacity
Channel capacity is additive over independent channels. It means that using two independent channels in a combined manner provides the same theoretical  capacity as using them independently.

This theorem states:

Shannon capacity of a graph
If G is an undirected graph, it can be used to define a communications channel in which the symbols are the graph vertices, and two codewords may be confused with each other if their symbols in each position are equal or adjacent. The computational complexity of finding the Shannon capacity of such a channel remains open, but it can be upper bounded by another important graph invariant, the Lovász number.

Noisy-channel coding theorem
The noisy-channel coding theorem states that for any error probability ε > 0 and for any transmission rate R less than the channel capacity C, there is an encoding and decoding scheme transmitting data at rate R whose error probability is less than ε, for a sufficiently large block length. Also, for any rate greater than the channel capacity, the probability of error at the receiver goes to 0.5 as the block length goes to infinity.

Example application
An application of the channel capacity concept to an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with B Hz bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio S/N is the Shannon–Hartley theorem:

  
    
      
        C
        =
        B
        
          log

        ⁡

          )
        
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle C=B\log _{2}\left(1+{\frac {S}{N}}\right)\ }
  C is measured in bits per second if the logarithm is taken in base 2, or nats per second if the natural logarithm is used, assuming B is in hertz; the signal and noise powers S and N are expressed in a linear power unit (like watts or volts2). Since S/N figures are often cited in dB, a conversion may be needed. For example, a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB corresponds to a linear power ratio of

Slow-fading channel
In a slow-fading channel, where the coherence time is greater than the latency requirement, there is no definite capacity as the maximum rate of reliable communications supported by the channel,

        R

    {\displaystyle p_{out}=\mathbb {P} (\log(1+|h|^{2}SNR)<R)}
  ,in which case the system is said to be in outage. With a non-zero probability that the channel is in deep fade, the capacity of the slow-fading channel in strict sense is zero. However, it is possible to determine the largest value of 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   such that the outage probability

   is less than 
  
    
      
        ϵ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon }
  . This value is known as the 
  
    
      
        ϵ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \epsilon }
  -outage capacity.

Fast-fading channel
In a fast-fading channel, where the latency requirement is greater than the coherence time and the codeword length spans many coherence periods, one can average over many independent channel fades by coding over a large number of coherence time intervals. Thus, it is possible to achieve a reliable rate of communication of 
  
    
      
        
          E
        
        (
        
          log

        ⁡
        (
        1
        +
        
          |
        
        h
        
          
            |
          
          
            2
          
        
        S
        N
        R
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {E} (\log _{2}(1+|h|^{2}SNR))}
   [bits/s/Hz] and it is meaningful to speak of this value as the capacity of the fast-fading channel.

Feedback Capacity
Feedback capacity is the greatest rate at which information can be reliably transmitted, per unit time, over a point-to-point communication channel in which the receiver feeds back the channel outputs to the transmitter. Information-theoretic analysis of communication systems that incorporate feedback is more complicated and challenging than without feedback. Possibly, this was the reason C.E. Shannon chose feedback as the subject of the first Shannon Lecture, delivered at the 1973 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory in Ashkelon, Israel.
The feedback capacity is characterized by the maximum of the directed information between the channel inputs and the channel outputs, where the maximization is with respect to the causal conditioning of the input given the output. The directed information was coined by James Massey in 1990, who showed that its an upper bound on feedback capacity. For memoryless channels, Shannon showed that feedback does not increase the capacity, and the feedback capacity coincides with the channel capacity characterized by the mutual information between the input and the output. The feedback capacity is known as a closed-form expression only for several examples such as: the Trapdoor channel, Ising channel, the binary erasure channel with a no-consecutive-ones input constraint, NOST channels.
The basic mathematical model for a communication system is the following:

Here is the formal definition of each element (where the only difference with respect to the nonfeedback capacity is the encoder definition):

Gaussian feedback capacity
When the Gaussian noise is colored, the channel has memory. Consider for instance the simple case on an autoregressive model noise process 
  
    
      
        
          z
          
            i
          
        
        =
        
          z
          
            i
            −
            1
          
        
        +
        
          w
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle z_{i}=z_{i-1}+w_{i}}
   where 
  
    
      
        
          w
          
            i
          
        
        ∼
        N
        (
        0
        ,
        1
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle w_{i}\sim N(0,1)}
   is an i.i.d. process.

Solution techniques
The feedback capacity is difficult to solve in the general case. There are some techniques that are related to control theory and Markov decision processes if the channel is discrete.
