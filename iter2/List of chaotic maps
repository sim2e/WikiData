In mathematics, a chaotic map is a map (namely, an evolution function) that exhibits some sort of chaotic behavior.  Maps may be parameterized by a discrete-time or a continuous-time parameter. Discrete maps usually take the form of iterated functions.  Chaotic maps often occur in the study of dynamical systems.
Chaotic maps often generate fractals. Although a fractal may be constructed by an iterative procedure, some fractals are studied in and of themselves, as sets rather than in terms of the map that generates them.  This is often because there are several different iterative procedures to generate the same fractal.
