Hey there. I just created this template.

I plan to insert this in the bottom of computer science algorithms articles that cover these topics.
I am aware that data structures already has its own navbox. I will probably leave this navbox out of those articles, but I wanted to include some popular data structures too since they are related.
This list was carefully picked from lists of top tags on popular DS&A exercise websites. I made some changes to nomenclature to avoid copyvio issues. My goal is to make sure all the most popular data structures and algorithms are included.â€“ Novem Linguae (talk) 08:15, 20 October 2020 (UTC)
