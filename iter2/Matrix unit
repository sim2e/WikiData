In linear algebra, a matrix unit is a matrix with only one nonzero entry with value 1.  The matrix unit with a 1 in the ith row and jth column is denoted as 
  
    
      
        
          E
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle E_{ij}}
  . For example, the 3 by 3 matrix unit with i = 1 and j = 2 is
A vector unit is a standard unit vector.
A single-entry matrix generalizes the matrix unit for matrices with only one nonzero entry of any value, not necessarily of value 1.

Properties
The set of m by n matrix units is a basis of the space of m by n matrices.The product of two matrix units of the same square shape 
  
    
      
        n
        ×
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\times n}
   satisfies the relation

where

    {\displaystyle \delta _{jk}}
   is the Kronecker delta.The group of scalar n-by-n matrices over a ring R is the centralizer of the subset of n-by-n matrix units in the set of n-by-n matrices over R.The matrix norm (induced by the same two vector norms) of a matrix unit is equal to 1.
When multiplied by another matrix, it isolates a specific row or column in arbitrary position. For example, for any 3-by-3 matrix A:
