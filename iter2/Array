An array is a systematic arrangement of similar objects, usually in rows and columns.

Things called an array include:

Music
In twelve-tone and serial composition, the presentation of simultaneous twelve-tone sets such that the sums of their horizontal segments form a succession of twelve-tone aggregates
Array mbira, a musical instrument
Spiral array model, a music pitch space

Science
Astronomy
A telescope array, also called astronomical interferometer.

Biology
Various kinds of multiple biological arrays called microarrays
Visual feature array, a model for the visual cortex

Computer science
Generally, a collection of same type data items that can be selected by indices computed at run-time, including:

Array (data structure), an arrangement of items at equally spaced addresses in computer memory
Array (data type), used in a programming language to specify a variable that can be indexed
Associative array, an abstract data structure model composed of key-value pairs, often implemented as a hash table or search treeor various kinds of the above, such as:

Bit array or bit vector
Dynamic array, allocated at run time
Jagged array, an array of arrays of which the member arrays can be of different lengths
Parallel array of records, with each field stored as a separate array
Sparse array, with most elements omitted, to store a sparse matrix
Variable-length arrayor various related concepts:

Array programming, using matrix algebra notation in programs (not the same as array processing)
Array slicing, the extraction of sub-arrays of an arrayor also:

Global Arrays, a library for parallel processing
Intel Array Visualizer, a piece of scientific graphics software
