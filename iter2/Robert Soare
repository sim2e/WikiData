Robert Irving Soare is an American mathematician. He is the Paul Snowden Russell Distinguished Service Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he has been on the faculty since 1967. He proved, together with Carl Jockusch, the low basis theorem, and has done other work in mathematical logic, primarily in the area of computability theory.
In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
