Since I've got no answer on wikiproject I'm reposting here.
Hello. I work essentially in the Portuguese version of Wikipedia, which has serious problems in Chemistry related articles. I found one template which in my opinion is confused, and it's basically the same in English version. It's about Template:Branches of chemistry, which connects different areas in three main topics. I think it's a kind of arbitrary definition, some of that areas (eg Polymer chemistry, Physical organic chemistry, Pharmacy, Surface science, Geochemistry, Solid-state chemistry, Materials science, etc) are actually the result of mixing the three main topics (Physical, Inorganic and Organic Chemistry) with others scientific areas. I wonder if it wouldn't be better in a template such as in the Template:Branches of biology case, without these divisions.  Rafael Kenneth (talk) 04:14, 13 September 2018 (UTC)

Sorry for the late answer (5 years later lol). I agree that polymer chemistry, organic, and pharmacy are subjects of the said Organic and Inorganic. I also think that it can be safely referred from both templates. AXONOV (talk) ⚑ 17:24, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
Hi. I wonder if this template can be converted to a general Chemistry template. Any objections? AXONOV (talk) ⚑ 17:25, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
