In chemistry, a reaction coordinate is an abstract one-dimensional coordinate chosen to represent progress along a reaction pathway. Where possible it is usually a geometric parameter that changes during the conversion of one or more molecular entities, such as bond length or bond angle.  For example, in the homolytic dissociation of molecular hydrogen, an apt choice would be the coordinate corresponding to the bond length.  Non-geometric parameters such as bond order are also used, but such direct representation of the reaction process can be difficult, especially for more complex reactions. 
In molecular dynamics simulations, a reaction coordinate is called a collective variable.A reaction coordinate parametrises reaction process at the level of the molecular entities involved.  It differs from extent of reaction, which measures reaction progress in terms of the composition of the reaction system.
(Free) energy is often plotted against reaction coordinate(s) to demonstrate in schematic form the potential energy profile (an intersection of a potential energy surface) associated with the reaction.
In the formalism of transition-state theory the reaction coordinate for each reaction step is one of a set of curvilinear coordinates obtained from the conventional coordinates for the reactants, and leads smoothly among configurations, from reactants to products via the transition state. It is typically chosen to follow the path defined by potential energy gradient – shallowest ascent/steepest descent – from reactants to products.
