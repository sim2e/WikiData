        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
   can be made into a unitary matrix by multiplying it by

  ; conversely, any unitary matrix whose entries all have modulus

    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {N}}}}
   becomes a complex Hadamard upon multiplication by 
  
    
      
        
          
            N
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {N}}}
  .
Complex Hadamard matrices arise in the study  of operator algebras and the theory of quantum computation.   Real Hadamard matrices and Butson-type Hadamard matrices form particular cases of complex Hadamard matrices.
Complex Hadamard matrices exist for any natural 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
   (compare the real case, in which existence is not known for every 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
  ). For instance the Fourier matrices (the complex conjugate of the DFT matrices without the normalizing factor),
