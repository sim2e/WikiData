The icon is waaay too big - compare with other stub icons. Enochlau 06:03, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
It's kind of... simple, too. I changed it to an image of Alan Turing, since the Turing machine was the most "universal" symbol of CS I could think of. Gazpacho 04:24, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

I think a picture of Alan Turing is a bad choice for an icon because Turing is not immediately recognizable like the Mona Lisa or Mickey Mouse. Also, a picture is harder to recognize: a picture of the Queen of England as an icon would be harder to recognize than a drawing as it appears on stamps or coins.I agree that the early comp. sci. icon was too big and too simplistic, but it served its purpose better than the current picture of Turing. We need something that suggests computer science to a large readership, and something that looks nice at icon size (i.e., not a real photo). Maybe an icon for a pocket calculator? Maybe a schematic picture of a computer chip? PhS 08:01, 20 September 2005 (UTC)What about this IBM 7090 image? Gazpacho 00:51, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

That will do, however I wasn't satisfied with that enormous size of 60 pixels. I decreased it, and its now 31 pixels.SoothingR 10:34, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
This one is barely readable at 32 pixels, I think the old one was better.SoothingR 09:59, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

This kind of picture is the right kind of idea. It is much better at evoking "computer science" than a person or a picture of a computer. However, the image itself is hard to read because it was not meant for this scale. We need something similar, with boxes and arrows, but designed for icon size. PhS 22:12, 13 February 2006 (UTC)
User:Zawersh proposed a new stub icon over at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer science. This icon keeps the "boxes and lines" style of the previous one, but looks much better at small scales. The reaction on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Computer science was generally positive, so I have replaced the old icon with the one supplied by User:Zawersh. --Allan McInnes (talk) 18:29, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
