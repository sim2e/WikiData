In numerical analysis, a numerical method is a mathematical tool designed to solve numerical problems. The implementation of a numerical method with an appropriate convergence check in a programming language is called a numerical algorithm.

Mathematical definition
Let 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)=0}
   be a well-posed problem, i.e. 
  
    
      
        F
        :
        X
        ×
        Y
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F:X\times Y\rightarrow \mathbb {R} }
   is a real or complex functional relationship, defined on the cross-product of an input data set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and an output data set 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
  , such that exists a locally lipschitz function 
  
    
      
        g
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle g:X\rightarrow Y}
   called resolvent, which has the property that for every root 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x,y)}
   of 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
  , 
  
    
      
        y
        =
        g
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=g(x)}
  . We define numerical method for the approximation of 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)=0}
  , the sequence of problems

            n
            ∈
            
              N
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{M_{n}\right\}_{n\in \mathbb {N} }=\left\{F_{n}(x_{n},y_{n})=0\right\}_{n\in \mathbb {N} },}
  with 
  
    
      
        
          F

  , 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        ∈
        
          X
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n}\in X_{n}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          y

            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y_{n}\in Y_{n}}
   for every 
  
    
      
        n
        ∈
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} }
  . The problems of which the method consists need not be well-posed. If they are, the method is said to be stable or well-posed.

Consistency
Necessary conditions for a numerical method to effectively approximate 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y)=0}
   are that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        →
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n}\rightarrow x}
   and that 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{n}}
   behaves like 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   when 
  
    
      
        n
        →
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\rightarrow \infty }
  . So, a numerical method is called consistent if and only if the sequence of functions 
  
    
      
        
          
            {
            
              F
              
                n
              
            
            }
          
          
            n
            ∈
            
              N
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{F_{n}\right\}_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}
   pointwise converges to 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   on the set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   of its solutions:

  
    
      
        lim
        
          F
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        +
        t
        )
        =
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        t
        )
        =
        0
        ,
        
        
        ∀
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        t
        )
        ∈
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lim F_{n}(x,y+t)=F(x,y,t)=0,\quad \quad \forall (x,y,t)\in S.}
  When 
  
    
      
        
          F
          
            n
          
        
        =
        F
        ,
        ∀
        n
        ∈
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle F_{n}=F,\forall n\in \mathbb {N} }
   on 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   the method is said to be strictly consistent.
