David S. Eisenberg (born 15 March 1939) is an American biochemist and biophysicist best known for his contributions to structural biology and computational molecular biology, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles since the early 1970s and director of the UCLA-DOE Institute for Genomics & Proteomics since the early 1990s, as well as a member of the California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI) at UCLA.

Education
Eisenberg attended Harvard University and graduated in 1961 with an A.B. in Biochemical Sciences. He went on to the University of Oxford, where he was awarded a D.Phil in 1965 for research supervised by Charles Coulson.

Research
Eisenberg's current research focuses on the structural biology of amyloidogenic proteins, while his computational efforts largely center on the development of bioinformatic/proteomic methodologies for elucidation and analysis of protein interaction networks. His research group hosts the Database of Interacting Proteins.

Career
Postdoctoral research, Princeton University (1964–1966; with Walter Kauzmann)
Postdoctoral research, California Institute of Technology (1966–1969; with Richard E. Dickerson)
Professor, Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, UCLA, USA (1969–Present)
Professor, Department of Biological Chemistry, UCLA Medical School
Director, UCLA-DOE Institute for Genomics & Proteomics (1993–Present)
Member, California NanoSystems Institute (CNSI), UCLA
Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute (2001–Present)

Awards
He was the recipient of Harvey Prize  (Human Health) 2008 in recognition of his contributions in unfolding the structure of amyloid fibrils. The award was presented to him at a ceremony that took place on March 23, 2009 at the Technion. This recently recognized protein state provides opportunities to understand cells in health and disease.
