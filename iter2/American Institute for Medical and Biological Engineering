The American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) is a non-profit organization founded in 1991, and headquartered in Washington. It represents 50,000 medical and biomedical engineers, and academic institutions, private industry, and professional engineering societies.

College of Fellows
Since AIMBE’s inception, over 2,500  individuals have been inducted to AIMBE’s College of Fellows. These fellows include heads of medical and engineering schools. Some Fellows work for the government, acting as consultants, or directing clinical trials. Some Fellows are members of other prominent academic institutions, such as the National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences. Others have received the National Medal of Science and the National Medal of Technology. Fellows elect a Chair of the College of Fellows, who presides over the election and induction of the new class and the AIMBE Annual Event. 
Fellows use the post-nominal FAIMBE.

Industry Council
The Industry Council consists of  corporate leaders in the biomedical engineering field.

Partnership with FDA
AIMBE is one of many organizations that has a Network of Experts Agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).It also partners with the FDA for its Scholars Program, which places post-doctorates in biomedical engineering fields in one-year positions at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health in Silver Spring, Maryland at the agency's White Oak campus, to serve as expert advisors to agency staff.
