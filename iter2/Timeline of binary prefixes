This timeline of binary prefixes lists events in the history of the evolution, development, and use of units of measure  which are germane to the definition of the binary prefixes by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 1998, used primarily with units of information such as the bit and the byte.
Historically, computers have used many systems of internal data representation, methods of operating on data elements, and data addressing. Early decimal computers included the ENIAC, UNIVAC 1, IBM 702, IBM 705, IBM 650, IBM 1400 series, and IBM 1620. Early binary addressed computers included Zuse Z3, Colossus, Whirlwind, AN/FSQ-7, IBM 701, IBM 704, IBM 709, IBM 7030, IBM 7090, IBM 7040, IBM System/360 and DEC PDP series.
Decimal systems typically had memory configured in whole decimal multiples, e.g., blocks of 100 and later 1,000. The unit abbreviation 'K' or 'k' if it was used, represented multiplication by 1,000. Binary memory had sizes of powers of two or small multiples thereof. In this context, 'K' or 'k' was sometimes used to denote multiples of 1,024 units or just the approximate size, e.g., either '64K' or '65K' for 65,536 (216).

1790s
1793
The French Commission temporaire de Poids & Mesures rêpublicaines, Décrets de la Convention Nationale, proposes the binary prefixes double and demi, denoting a factor of 2 (21) and 1⁄2 (2−1), respectively, in 1793.

1795
The prefixes double and demi are part of the original metric system adopted by France (with kilo for 1000) in 1795. These were not retained when the decadic SI prefixes were internationally adopted by the 11th CGPM conference in 1960.

1870s
Metric prefix "mega-" established in 1873.

1930s
Metric prefixes "kilo-" (established 1795) and mega- (established 1873) are widely used as decimal multipliers 1,000 and 1,000,000 for units of frequency and impedance in the electronics industry.
The Committee of the Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker publishes suggested names and symbols for the metric prefixes with decimal meaning, i.e., giga (G=109) and tera (T=1012).

1940s
1943–1944
J. W. Tukey coins the word "bit" as an abbreviation of "binary digit".

1947
"The Whirlwind I Computer is planned with a storage capacity of 2,048 numbers of 16 binary digits each."

1948
Tukey's "bit" is referenced in the work of information theorist Claude Shannon.

1950s
In the 1950s, "1 kilobit" meant 1000 bits:"In the '50s, amazingly enough—and only total coincidence—I actually was given the job of writing the operational specifications [...] for what was called cross telling. They handed me this thing and said, 'You're going to define how the hand-over process works between direction centers', [...] and I had no idea what they were talking about. But we had [...] one-kilobit lines connecting the direction centers and I thought, 'Good God! 1,000 bits a second. Well, we'll surely be able to figure out something to do with that.'" — Saverah Warenstein, former programmer at Lincoln Laboratory, IBM

1952
The first magnetic core memory, from the IBM 405 Alphabetical Accounting Machine, is tested successfully in April 1952. (The image shows 10 × 12 cores; presumably one of 8)"Teaming up with a more experienced engineer, [Mike Haynes] built a core memory with just enough capacity to store all the information in an IBM punch card: 960 bits in an 80 × 12 array. In May 1952 it was successfully tested as a data buffer between a Type 405 alphabetical accounting machine and a Type 517 summary punch. This first functional test of a ferrite core memory was made in the same month that a four-times smaller 16 × 16-bit ferrite core array was successfully tested at MIT."
The IBM 701, a binary-addressed computer containing 72 Williams tubes of 1024 bits each, is released in April.Principles of Operation Type 701 does not use prefixes with lengths of words or size of storage. For example, it specifies that memory tubes hold 2048 words each.
The IBM 737 optional magnetic core storage stores 4,096 36-bit words. Each plane stored 64 × 64 = 4,096 bits.

1955
The IBM 704 (a binary machine) manual uses decimal arithmetic for powers of two, without prefixes"Magnetic core storage units are available with capacities of either 4,096 or 32,768 core storage registers; or two magnetic core storage units, each with a capacity of 4,096 core storage registers, may be used. Thus, magnetic core storage units are available to give the calculator a capacity of 4,096, 8,192, or 32,768 core storage registers."
"Each drum has a storage capacity of 2048 words."

1956
The IBM 702 (a decimally addressed machine)  Preliminary Manual of Information uses decimal arithmetic for powers of ten, without prefixes."Electrostatic memory is the principal storage medium within the machine. It consists of cathode ray tubes which can store up to 10,000 characters of information in the form of electrostatic charges ....  Additional storage, as required, may be provided through the use of magnetic drum storage units, each having a capacity of 60,000 characters."
"A character may be a letter of the alphabet, a decimal number, or any of eleven different punctuation marks or symbols used in report printing."
"Each one of the 10,000 positions of memory is numbered from 0000 to 9999 and each stored character must occupy one of these positions." (page 8)
The word byte, meaning eight bits, is coined by Dr. Werner Buchholz in June 1956, during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer.
IBM 650 RAMAC (a decimal addressed machine) announcement"The 650 RAMAC combines the IBM 650 Magnetic Drum Data Processing Machine with a series of disk memory units which are capable of storing a total of 24-million digits. The 305 RAMAC is an entirely new machine which contains its own input and output devices and processing unit as well as a built-in 5-million-digit disk memory."

1957
The IBM 705 (a decimal addressed machine) Operating manual uses decimal arithmetic for powers of ten, without prefixes."A total of 40,000 characters can be stored within the main storage unit of the Type 705."
"Each one of the 40,000 positions in memory is numbered from 0000 to 39,999." (page 17)
"One or more magnetic drums are available as optional equipment with a capacity of 60,000 characters each."

The 11th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) announces the Système International d'Unités (SI) and adds the decimal metric prefixes giga, and tera, defined as 109 and 1012
U.S. Patent 3,214,691 Frequency Diversity Communications System is filed on May 13, 1960:
"In actual construction, the delay line, which provides a total delay from one end to the other of one baud (10 microseconds for a 100 kilobit per second information rate), may be fabricated from lumped parameter elements, i.e., inductors and capacitors, in a well-known manner."
"At a 100 kilobit per second information rate, both mark and space signals will generally be transmitted in any 0.0001 sec, interval, and therefore this requirement is easily met with conventional resistors and capacitors."
Gruenberger, Fred; Burgess, C. R. (October 1960). "Letters to the Editor". Communications of the ACM. 3 (10). doi:10.1145/367415.367419. S2CID 3199685.
The 8K core stores were getting fairly common in this country in 1954. The 32K store started mass production in 1956; it is the standard now for large machines and at least 200 machines of the size (or its equivalent in the character addressable machines) are in existence today (and at least 100 were in existence in mid-1959).

1955–1961
A search of the Computer History Museum's Stretch collection of 931 text documents dated from September 1955 through September 1961 shows no usage of k or K to describe main storage size.

1961
Gray, L.; Graham, R. (1961). Radio Transmitters. New York, USA: McGraw-Hill. ISBN 978-0-07-024240-1. In the case of the transmission of business-machine or telemetered data, it is more usual to express the speed in bits or kilobits (1,000 bits) per second.
Quoted in OED as first instance of "kilobit", though "it is more usual" suggests it is already in common use (see timeline entry for 1957)
Described device contains 512 words, 24 bits each (=12,288 bits)
"It is no longer reasonable to spend as much time to transmit an 80 bit address as 12 kilobits of message information-a 1500 to 1 ratio.... We have theoretically and experimentally proved that speech can be compressed from the straightforward requirement for 48 kilobit PCM channel capability to 2400 bits by the application of the Dudley syllabic vocoder."
The IBM 7090 Data Processing System (a binary machine), Additional Core Storage (65K means "approximately 65000")"The Additional Core Storage feature for the IBM 7090 Data Processing System provides a second IBM 7302 Core Storage, increasing the capacity of main storage by 32,768 words. The block of storage represented by both 7302 units is referred to as "main storage unit."
"Additional core storage provides two methods of using main storage: (1) The 65K mode—the computer program is enabled to address both of the main storage units, and (2) the 32K mode—the computer program is able to address only one storage unit, so that main storage capacity available to that program is effectively 32,768 words."
The IBM 1410 Data Processing System, which used modified decimal addressing, uses decimal arithmetic for powers of ten, without prefixes"Core storage units are available in 10,000-, 20,000- or 40,000-character position capacities."
"The matrix switch makes it possible to address any one of the 100 X-drive lines (in a 10K core array)."
"The 40K core array requires 40,000 valid five-position addresses from 0,000 to 39,999."
"This operation check detects errors in programming that cause invalid addresses. Examples: 40,000-and-above on a 40K core array; 20,000-and-above on a 20K core array.  On a 10K core array, invalid addresses are detected by the address-bus validity check."

1962
A reference to a "4k IBM 1401" meant 4,000 characters of storage (memory).

1963
Ludwig uses kilobit in the decimal sense
DEC Serial Drum Type 24"Drums are equipped to store either 64, 128, or 256 data blocks, providing a memory capability of 16384, 32768, or 65536 computer words"  (no abbreviations)
Honeywell 200 Summary Description"The main memory is a magnetic core ... The memory unit supplied as part of the basic central processor has a capacity of 2,048 characters, each of which is stored in a separate, addressable, memory location.  This capacity may be expanded in modular increments by adding one 2,048-character module and additional 4,096-character modules."
"Random access disc file and control (disc capacities of up to 100 million characters are available.)"
"Up to eight drum storage units can be connected to the Model 270 Random Access Drum Control. Each drum provides storage for 2,621,441 characters, allowing a total capacity of approximately 21 million characters."

1964
Gene Amdahl's seminal April 1964 article on IBM System/360 used 1K to mean 1024.
Leng, Gordon Bell, et al., use K in the binary sense: "The computer has two blocks of 4K, 18-bit words of memory, (1K=1024 words), attached to its central processor"
Falkin, Joel; Savastano, Sal (May 1963). "Sorting with large volume, random access, drum storage". Communications of the ACM. 6 (5): 240–244. doi:10.1145/366552.366580. S2CID 11220089. The Teleregister Telefile data processor includes drum storage whose capacity is far in excess of the requirements for sorting. ... The Telefile data processor provides 16,000 positions in memory, each position storing one binary coded decimal character. A floating accumulator arrangement allows the accumulator to contain any field in memory from 1 to 100 characters in length. All indexing is accomplished programmatically. Input and output tape blocking is fixed at 300 characters per block.

"An IBM 1401 Data Processing System with the following minimum configuration is also required: 1. 4K positions of core storage" U.S. Patent 3,317,902 – ADDRESS SELECTION CONTROL APPARATUS – Filed April 6, 1964
"To facilitate understanding of the invention, the main storage area has been illustrated as being of 8K capacity; however, it is to be understood that the main storage area may be of larger capacity (e.g., 16K, 32K or 64K) by storing address selection control data in bit positions '2', '1' and '0' of M register 197, respectively."

"Each IBM 2315 disk cartridge can hold the equivalent of more than one million characters of information.
"One method of designing a slave memory for instructions is as follows. Suppose that the main memory has 64K words (where K=1024) and, therefore, 16 address bits, and that the slave memory has 32 words and, therefore, 5 address bits."
IBM 1620 CPU Model 1 (a decimal machine) System Reference Library, dated 19 July 1965, states:
"A core storage module, which is 20,000 addressable positions of magnetic core storage, is located in the 1620. Two additional modules are available ... Each core storage module (20,000 positions) is made up of 12 core planes as shown in Figure 3. Each core plane contains all cores for a specific bit value."

U.S. Patent 3,435,420 CONTIGUOUS BULK STORAGE ADDRESSING is filed on 3 January 1966
"Note that 'K' as used herein indicates 'thousands.' Each storage location in the present embodiment includes 64 data bits and 8 related parity bits, as described herein."
"Thus, if only storage unit 1A were provided, it would contain addresses 0 through 32K; storage IB would include addresses between 32K and 64K, storage 2A would contain addresses between 64K and 96K, ..."

A Univac 9400 disc based computer system ... "can have 2–8 8411 drives for 14.5–58 megabytes capacity. The 8411 has a transfer rate of 156K bytes per second." using megabytes in a decimal sense
Donald Morrison proposes to use the Greek letter kappa ("κ") to denote 1024 bytes, "κ2" to denote 1024×1024, and so on. (At the time, memory size was small, and only 'K' was in widespread use.)
Wallace Givens responded with a proposal to use "bK" as an abbreviation for 1024 and "bK2" or "bK2" for 1024×1024, though he noted that neither the Greek letter nor lowercase letter "b" would be easy to reproduce on computer printers of the day.
Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory further proposed that the prefixes be abandoned altogether, and the letter B be used to indicate a base-2 exponent in binary scientific notation, similar to E in decimal scientific notation, to create shorthands like 3B20 for 3×220

Bibcode:1972ITM.....8..390L. doi:10.1109/TMAG.1972.1067329. Also, random access devices are advantageous over serial access devices for backing store applications only when the memory capacity is less than 1 Mbyte. For capacities of 4 Mbyte and 16 Mbyte serial access stores with shift register lengths of 256 bit and 1024 bit, respectively, look favorable.

1984
The Macintosh Operating System is the earliest known operating system using the prefix K in a binary sense to report memory size and HDD capacity.In the original 1984 Apple Macintosh ad, page 8, Apple characterized its 31⁄2 floppy disk as "400K," that is, 800×512 byte sectors or 409,600 bytes = 400 KiB. Similarly, the February 1984 Byte Magazine review describes the FD as "400K bytes".

1985
Exabyte Corp. founded
September 1985. Apple introduced Macintosh Finder 5.0 with HFS (Hierarchical File System)along with the Mac's first hard drive, the Hard Disk 20. Finder 5.x displayed drive capacity in binary K units. The Hard Disk 20 Manual specified the HDD as having
"Data capacity (formatted): 20,769,280 bytes
Bytes per block: 532 (512 user data, 20 system data)
Total disk blocks: 39,040
and has the following definition in its glossary:megabyteApproximately one million bytes (1,048,567) of information. A 20 megabyte hard disk holds 20 million bytes of information, or 20,000 kilobytes (20,000K) (Apple Hard Disk 20 Manual)The user data is 39,040 × 512 = 19,988,480 bytes here.

GEOS ad"512K of memory"
The enhanced DOS command line processor 4DOS 3.00 supports a number of additional conditions (DISKFREE, DOSMEM/DOSFREE, EMS, EXTENDED, FILESIZE and XMS) in IF commands, which allow to test for sizes in bytes, kilobytes (by appending a K) or megabytes (by appending an M), where 1K is defined as 1024 bytes and 1M is defined as 1024*1024 bytes.This is the first known instance of an operating system or utility using M in a binary sense.

Similar to a feature in 4DOS 3.00, the enhanced command line processor 4DOS 4.00 adds support for a number of variable functions (like %@FILESIZE[...]%), taking special arguments to control the format of the returned values: The lowercase letters k and m are used as decimal prefixes, whereas the uppercase letters K and M are used in their binary meaning.

1993
While the HP 48G calculators are labelled 32K or 128K to describe their built-in SRAM capacity in a binary sense, the user manual variably uses the terms KB, KBytes and kilobytes in the same meaning.
The enhanced command line processor 4DOS 5.00 introduces the concept of a general size range parameter /[smin,max] for file selection, recognizing lowercase letters k and m as decimal prefixes and uppercase letters K and M as binary prefixes.

FOLDOC defines the exabyte (1 EB) as 1024 petabytes (1024 PB), with petabyte used in the binary sense of 10245 B.
Markus Kuhn proposes a system with di prefixes, like the "dikilobyte" (K2B) and "digigabyte" (G2B). It did not see significant adoption.

1997
January:  Bruce Barrow endorses the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry's proposal for prefixes kibi, mebi, gibi, etc. in  "A Lesson in Megabytes" in IEEE Standards Bearer
IEEE requires prefixes to take the standard SI meaning (e.g., mega always to mean 10002).  Exceptions for binary meaning (mega to mean 10242) are permitted as an interim measure (where pointed out on a case-by-case basis) until a binary prefix could be standardised.
FOLDOC defines the zettabyte (1 ZB) as 1024 exabytes (1024 EB) and the yottabyte (1 YB) as 1024 zettabytes (1024 ZB).

1998
December: IEC establishes unambiguous prefixes for binary multiples (KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB and EiB), reserving kB, MB, GB and so on for their decimal sense.  Formally published in January 1999.

1999
Donald Knuth, who uses decimal notation like 1 MB = 1000 kB, expresses "astonishment" that the proposal was adopted by the IEC, calling them "funny-sounding", and proposes that the powers of 1024 be designated as "large kilobytes" and "large megabytes" (abbreviated KKB and MMB, as "doubling the letter connotes both binary-ness and large-ness"). Double prefixes were formerly used in the metric system, however, with a multiplicative meaning ("MMB" would be equivalent to "TB"), and this proposed usage never gained any traction.
In their November 1999 paper, Steven W. Schlosser, John Linwood Griffin, David F. Nagle and Gregory R. Ganger adopt the symbol GiB for gibibyte and quote data throughput in mebibytes per second
"... Although these numbers appear to yield a capacity of 2.98 GiB per sled, the capacity decreases ... This yields an effective capacity of about 2.098 GiB per sled. ..."
"maximum throughput (MiB/s)"
The IEEE 802.11-1999 standard introduces the binary time unit TU defined as 1024 μs (10−6 Kis).

Peuhkuri adopts IEC prefixes in his paper at the 2001 Internet Measurement Conference: "... allows maximum size of 224 that requires 1 GiB of RAM ... or acknowledgement numer [sic] is within 32 KiB range. ... on a PC with Celeron processor with 512 MiB of memory ..."
The Linux kernel uses IEC prefixes.

2002
Marcus Kuhn introduces the term kibihertz to mean 1024 Hz."Most embedded clocks (state of the art is still a calibrated 32 kibihertz crystal) have a frequency error of at least 10^-5 (10 ppm), and therefore drift away from the TAI rate faster than 1 second per week."
Mackenzie et al 2002:
use tebibyte (TiB), pebibyte (PiB), exbibyte (EiB)
use the symbols ZiB, YiB, accompanied by notes explaining that these are "a GNU extension to IEC 60027-2"

2003
The World Wide Web Consortium publishes a Working Group Note describing how to incorporate IEC prefixes into mathematical markup.

2004
2004 revision of IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Units of Measurement (SI Units, Customary Inch-Pound Units, and Certain Other Units), IEEE Std 260.1, incorporates IEC definitions for KiB, MiB etc., reserving the symbols kB, MB etc. for their decimal counterparts.

2005
IEC extends binary prefixes to include zebi (Zi) and yobi (Yi)
IEC prefixes are adopted by the IEEE after a two-year trial period.
On March 19, 2005, the IEEE standard IEEE 1541-2002 (Prefixes for Binary Multiples) was elevated to a full-use standard by the IEEE Standards Association after a two-year trial period.

2006
The BIPM publishes the 8th SI Brochure including the note"These SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10. They should not be used to indicate powers of 2 [...]. The IEC has adopted prefixes for binary powers [...]. Although these prefixes are not part of the SI, they should be used in the field of information technology to avoid the incorrect usage of the SI prefixes."
In addition to the k and m decimal as well as the K and M binary prefixes, 4DOS 7.50.141 (2006-12-24) adds support for g and G as decimal respective binary prefixes in variable functions and size range parameters.

2007
Windows Vista still uses the binary conventions (e.g., 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1048576 bytes) for file and drive sizes, and for data rates
GParted uses IEC prefixes for partition sizes
Advanced Packaging Tool and Synaptic Package Manager use standard SI prefixes for file sizes
IBM uses "exabyte" to mean 10246 bytes. "Each address space, called a 64-bit address space, is 16 exabytes (EB) in size; an exabyte is slightly more than one billion gigabytes. The new address space has logically 264 addresses. It is 8 billion times the size of the former 2-gigabyte address space, or 18,446,744,073,709,600,000 bytes."

2008
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines require use of IEC prefixes KiB, MiB ... (and not kB, MB) for binary byte multiplesp. 29, "The names and symbols for the prefixes corresponding to 210, 220, 230, 240, 250, and 260 are, respectively: kibi, Ki; mebi, Mi; gibi, Gi; tebi, Ti; pebi, Pi; and exbi, Ei. Thus, for example, one kibibyte is also written as 1 KiB = 2 10  B = 1024 B, where B denotes the unit byte. Although these prefixes are not part of the SI, they should be used in the field of information technology to avoid the non-standard usage of the SI prefixes."
The binary prefixes are defined in IEC Standard IEC 80000-13, formally incorporating them into the ISO/IEC series of standards of quantities and units.
IBM WebSphere describes data transfer using unambiguous IEC prefixes"The name of the file currently being transferred. The part of the individual file that has already been transferred is displayed in B, KiB, MiB, GiB, or TiB along with total size of the file in parentheses. The unit of measurement displayed depends on the size of the file. B is bytes per second. KiB/s is kibibytes per second, where 1 kibibyte equals 1024 bytes. MiB/s is mebibytes per second, where 1 mebibyte equals 1 048 576 bytes. GiB/s is gibibytes per second where 1 gibibyte equals 1 073 741 824 bytes. TiB/s is tebibytes per second where 1 tebibyte equals 1 099 511 627 776 bytes.""The rate the file is being transferred in KiB/s (kibibytes per second, where 1 kibibyte equals 1024 bytes.)"

2009
Apple Inc. uses the SI decimal definitions for capacity (e.g., 1 kilobyte = 1000 bytes) in the Mac OS X v10.6 operating system to conform with standards body recommendations and avoid conflict with hard drive manufacturers' specifications.
Frank Löffler and co-workers report disk size and computer memory in tebibytes."For the largest simulations using 2048 cores this sums up to about 650 GiB per complete checkpoint and about 6.4 TiB in total (for 10 checkpoints)."
the SourceForge web site"For example, in 2009, the SourceForge web site reported file sizes using binary prefixes for several months before changing back to SI prefixes but switching the file sizes to powers of ten."
The binary prefixes, as defined by IEC 80000-13, are incorporated into ISO 80000-1, including a note that "SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10, and should not be used for powers of 2." In ISO 80000-1, the application of the binary prefixes is not limited to computer technology. For example, 1 KiHz = 1024 Hz.

2010s
2010
The Ubuntu operating system uses the SI prefixes for base-10 numbers and IEC prefixes for base-2 numbers as of the 10.10 release.
Baba Arimilli and co-workers use the pebibyte (PiB) for computer memory and disk storage and exbibyte (EiB) for archival storage"Blue Waters will comprise more than 300.000 POWER7 cores, more than 1 PiB memory, more than 10 PiB disk storage, more than 0.5 EiB archival storage, and achieve around 10 PF/s peak performance."
HP publishes a leaflet explaining use of SI and binary prefixes "To reduce confusion, vendors are pursuing one of two remedies: they are changing SI prefixes to the new binary prefixes, or they are recalculating the numbers as powers of ten.""For disk and file capacities, the latter remedy is more popular because it is much easier to recognize that 300 GB is the same as 300,000 MB than to recognize that 279.4 GiB is the same as 286,102 MiB."
"For memory capacities, binary prefixes are more natural. For example, reporting a Smart Array controller cache size of 512 MiB is preferable to reporting it as 536.9 MB."
"HP is considering modifying its storage utilities to report disk capacity with correct decimal and binary values side-by-side (for example, '300 GB (279.4 GiB)'), and report cache sizes with binary prefixes ('1 GiB')."

2011
The GNU operating system uses the SI prefixes for base-10 numbers and IEC prefixes for base-2 numbers as of the parted-2.4 release (May 2011).
"specifying partition start or end values using MiB, GiB, etc. suffixes now makes parted do what I want, i.e., use that precise value, and not some other that is up to 500KiB or 500MiB away from what I specified. Before, to get that behavior, you would have had to use carefully chosen values with units of bytes ('B') or sectors ('s') to obtain the same result, and with sectors, your usage would not be portable between devices with varying sector sizes.  This change does not affect how parted handles suffixes like KB, MB, GB, etc."
"Note that as of parted-2.4, when you specify start and/or end values using IEC binary units like 'MiB', 'GiB', 'TiB', etc., parted treats those values as exact, and equivalent to the same number specified in bytes (i.e., with the 'B' suffix), in that it provides no 'helpful' range of sloppiness. Contrast that with a partition start request of '4GB', which may actually resolve to some sector up to 500MB before or after that point. Thus, when creating a partition, you should prefer to specify units of bytes ('B'), sectors ('s'), or IEC binary units like 'MiB', but not 'MB', 'GB', etc."
On its Archive Project Request Form, the University of Oxford uses IEC prefixes: "The initial amount of data to be archived ( MiB GiB TiB )"
The IBM Style Guide permits IEC prefixes or "SI prefixes" if used consistently and explained to the user "Whether you choose to use IEC prefixes for powers of 2 and SI prefixes for powers of 10, or use SI prefixes for a dual purpose ... be consistent in your usage and explain to the user your adopted system."

June: Toshiba describes data transfer rates in units of MiB/s. In the same Press Release, SSD storage capacity is given in decimal gigabytes, accompanied by the footnote "One Gigabyte (GB) means 109 = 1,000,000,000 bytes using powers of 10.  A computer operating system, however, reports storage capacity using powers of 2 for the definition of 1 GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes and therefore shows less storage capacity"

IBM's Customer Information Center uses IEC prefixes to disambiguate"To reduce the possibility of confusion, this information center represents data storage using both decimal and binary units. Data storage values are displayed using the following format:#### decimal unit (binary unit).  By this example, the value 512 terabytes is displayed as: 512 TB (465.6 TiB)"

Hybrid drives MQ01ABD100H and MQ01ABD075H are described as having a buffer size of 32 MiB."1 MB (megabytes) = 1,000,000 bytes, 1 GB (gigabytes) = 1,000,000,000 bytes, 1 TB (terabytes) = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes"
"KiB (kebibytes [sic]) = 1,024 (210 bytes), MiB (mebibytes) = 1,048,576 (220) bytes, GiB (gibibytes) = 1,073,741,824 (230) bytes".

2020s
2020
A Californian court finds that, as the NIST specifies that prefixes such as "G" are decimal rather than binary, and that California law specifies that the NIST definitions of measure "shall govern ... transactions in this state", and because the vendor of a 64 GB flash drive with 64 billion bytes indicated on the packaging of the drive that 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes, they did not deceive consumers into believing that the drive had 64×1024×1024×1024 bytes.

2021
Ainslie, Halvorsen and Robinson point out the parallel with the confusion between a one-third octave and a one-tenth decade in acoustics."The near coincidence between ten octaves and three decades (210 ≈ 103) is identical to the one that causes confusion in the computer industry by use of the term 'kilobyte' to mean 1024 B ... when the internationally accepted use of the prefix kilo requires it to mean 1000 B."

2022
February: IEEE 1541 is amended to include the prefixes zebi and yobi.
November: The additional decimal prefixes ronna- for 10009 and quetta- for 100010 are adopted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). Binary counterparts to ronna- and quetta- were suggested in a consultation paper of the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU) for the International Committee for Weights and Measures as robi- (Ri, 10249) and quebi- (Qi, 102410), but so far they have not been adopted by the IEC or ISO.
