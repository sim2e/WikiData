Hybrid functionals are a class of approximations to the exchange–correlation energy functional in density functional theory (DFT) that incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree–Fock theory with the rest of the exchange–correlation energy from other sources (ab initio or empirical). The exact exchange energy functional is expressed in terms of the Kohn–Sham orbitals rather than the density, so is termed an implicit density functional.  One of the most commonly used versions is B3LYP, which stands for "Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr".

Origin
The hybrid approach to constructing density functional approximations was introduced by Axel Becke in 1993.  Hybridization with Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange (also called exact exchange) provides a simple scheme for improving the calculation of many molecular properties, such as atomization energies, bond lengths and vibration frequencies, which tend to be poorly described with simple "ab initio" functionals.

Method
A hybrid exchange–correlation functional is usually constructed as a linear combination of the Hartree–Fock exact exchange functional

The parameters determining the weight of each individual functional are typically specified by fitting the functional's predictions to experimental or accurately calculated thermochemical data, although in the case of the "adiabatic connection functionals" the weights can be set a priori.

Meta-hybrid GGA

The M06 suite of functionals is a set of four meta-hybrid GGA and meta-GGA DFT functionals. These functionals are constructed by empirically fitting their parameters, while being constrained to a uniform electron gas.
The family includes the functionals M06-L, M06, M06-2X and M06-HF, with a different amount of exact exchange for each one. M06-L is fully local without HF exchange (thus it cannot be considered hybrid), M06 has 27% HF exchange, M06-2X 54% and M06-HF 100%.
The advantages and usefulness of each functional are

M06-L: Fast, good for transition metals, inorganic and organometallics.
M06: For main group, organometallics, kinetics and non-covalent bonds.
M06-2X: Main group, kinetics.
M06-HF: Charge-transfer TD-DFT, systems where self-interaction is pathological.The suite gives good results for systems containing dispersion forces, one of the biggest deficiencies of standard DFT methods. 
Medvedev, Perdew, et al. say: "Despite their excellent performance for energies and geometries, we must suspect that modern highly parameterized functionals need further guidance from exact constraints, or exact density, or both"
