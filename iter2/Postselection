In probability theory, to postselect is to condition a probability space upon the occurrence of a given event. In symbols, once we postselect for an event 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
  , the probability of some other event 
  
    
      
        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   changes from 
  
    
      
        Pr
        ⁡
        [
        F
        ]
      
    
    {\textstyle \operatorname {Pr} [F]}
   to the conditional probability 
  
    
      
        Pr
        ⁡
        [
        F
        
        
          |
        
        
        E
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Pr} [F\,|\,E]}
  .
For a discrete probability space, 
  
    
      
        Pr
        ⁡
        [
        F
        
        
          |
        
        
        E
        ]
        =
        
          
            
              Pr
              ⁡
              [
              F
              
              ∩
              
              E
              ]
            
            
              Pr
              ⁡
              [
              E
              ]
            
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle \operatorname {Pr} [F\,|\,E]={\frac {\operatorname {Pr} [F\,\cap \,E]}{\operatorname {Pr} [E]}}}
  , and thus we require that 
  
    
      
        Pr
        ⁡
        [
        E
        ]
      
    
    {\textstyle \operatorname {Pr} [E]}
   be strictly positive in order for the postselection to be well-defined.
See also PostBQP, a complexity class defined with postselection. Using postselection it seems quantum Turing machines are much more powerful: Scott Aaronson proved PostBQP is equal to PP.
Some quantum experiments use post-selection after the experiment as a replacement for communication during the experiment, by post-selecting the communicated value into a constant.
