The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to robotics:
Robotics is a  branch of mechanical  engineering, electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.
The word "robot" was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The term "robotics" was coined by Isaac Asimov in his 1941 science fiction short-story "Liar!"

Nature of robotics
Robotics can be described as:

An applied science – scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment.
A branch of computer science –
A branch of electrical engineering –
A branch of mechanical engineering –
Research and development –
A branch of technology   –

Branches of robotics
Adaptive control – control method used by a controller which must adapt to a controlled system with parameters which vary, or are initially uncertain. For example, as an aircraft flies, its mass will slowly decrease as a result of fuel consumption; a control law is needed that adapts itself to such changing conditions.
Aerial robotics – development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, aircraft without a human pilot aboard. Their flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle.
Android science – interdisciplinary framework for studying human interaction and cognition based on the premise that a very humanlike robot (that is, an android) can elicit human-directed social responses in human beings.
Anthrobotics – science of developing and studying robots that are either entirely or in some way human-like.
Artificial intelligence – the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it.
Artificial neural networks – a mathematical model inspired by biological neural networks.
Autonomous car – an autonomous vehicle capable of fulfilling the human transportation capabilities of a traditional car
Autonomous research robotics –
Bayesian network –
BEAM robotics – a style of robotics that primarily uses simple analogue circuits instead of a microprocessor in order to produce an unusually simple design (in comparison to traditional mobile robots) that trades flexibility for robustness and efficiency in performing the task for which it was designed.
Behavior-based robotics – the branch of robotics that incorporates modular or behavior based AI (BBAI).
Bio-inspired robotics – making robots that are inspired by biological systems. Biomimicry and bio-inspired design are sometimes confused. Biomimicry is copying the nature while bio-inspired design is learning from nature and making a mechanism that is simpler and more effective than the system observed in nature.
Biomimetic  – see Bionics.
Biomorphic robotics – a sub-discipline of robotics focused upon emulating the mechanics, sensor systems, computing structures and methodologies used by animals.
Bionics  – also known as biomimetics, biognosis, biomimicry, or bionical creativity engineering is the application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology.
Biorobotics – a study of how to make robots that emulate or simulate living biological organisms mechanically or even chemically.
Cloud robotics – is a field of robotics that attempts to invoke cloud technologies such as cloud computing, cloud storage, and other Internet technologies centered around the benefits of converged infrastructure and shared services for robotics.
Cognitive robotics – views animal cognition as a starting point for the development of robotic information processing, as opposed to more traditional Artificial Intelligence techniques.
Clustering –
Computational neuroscience – study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system.
Robot control – a study of controlling robots
Robotics conventions –
Data mining Techniques –
Degrees of freedom – in mechanics, the degree of freedom (DOF) of a mechanical system is the number of independent parameters that define its configuration. It is the number of parameters that determine the state of a physical system and is important to the analysis of systems of bodies in mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering, robotics, and structural engineering.
Developmental robotics – a methodology that uses metaphors from neural development and developmental psychology to develop the mind for autonomous robots

Programming by Demonstration – an End-user development technique for teaching a computer or a robot new behaviors by demonstrating the task to transfer directly instead of programming it through machine commands.
Quantum robotics – a subfield of robotics that deals with using quantum computers to run robotics algorithms more quickly than digital computers can.

Aspects of speech processing includes the acquisition, manipulation, storage, transfer and output of digital speech signals.
