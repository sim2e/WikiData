Why don't we change the title of this template to ≪Quantum information≫? I think quantum computation is a subordinate concept of quantum information. But this template includes quantum information in the list though the name of this template includes computing -- Modamoda (talk) 05:55, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

I don't mind either title, but I agree that quantum information is a superset of quantum computation, and the template currently seems to have all of quantum information. --Robin (talk) 20:57, 28 January 2010 (UTC)
I moved it. thanks for your opinion :) -- Modamoda (talk) 08:30, 30 January 2010 (UTC)
Should there be a section added for links to quantum information scientists? For instance, David DiVincenzo, Peter Shor, Anton Zeilinger, David Deutsch, Alain Aspect, Peter_Zoller, Rainer Blatt, Nicolas Gisin and other significant figures? This may also entice users to add to these articles when browsing quantum information pages, given the interconnectivity. Tyttcfm (talk) 12:34, 21 June 2017 (UTC)

I'm not sure why they're there, but the asterisks between links look hideous, and in several spots there are multiple. Can these be removed? --Nerd1a4i (talk) 13:23, 23 September 2017 (UTC)
