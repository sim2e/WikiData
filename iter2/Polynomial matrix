In mathematics, a polynomial matrix or matrix of polynomials is a matrix whose elements are univariate or multivariate polynomials. Equivalently, a polynomial matrix is a polynomial whose coefficients are matrices.
A univariate polynomial matrix P of degree p is defined as:

  
    
      
        P
        =
        
          ∑

    {\displaystyle P=\sum _{n=0}^{p}A(n)x^{n}=A(0)+A(1)x+A(2)x^{2}+\cdots +A(p)x^{p}}
  where

        (
        i
        )

   denotes a matrix of constant coefficients, and

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle A(p)}
   is non-zero.

  We can express this by saying that for a ring R, the rings 
  
    
      
        
          M
          
            n

        [
        X
        ]
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle M_{n}(R[X])}
   and

  
    
      
        (
        
          M
          
            n
          
        
        (
        R
        )

        [
        X
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle (M_{n}(R))[X]}
   are isomorphic.

Properties
A polynomial matrix over a field with determinant equal to a non-zero element of that field is called unimodular, and has an inverse that is also a polynomial matrix. Note that the only scalar unimodular polynomials are polynomials of degree 0 – nonzero constants, because an inverse of an arbitrary polynomial of higher degree is a rational function.
The roots of a polynomial matrix over the complex numbers are the points in the complex plane where the matrix loses rank.
The determinant of a matrix polynomial with Hermitian positive-definite (semidefinite) coefficients is a polynomial with positive (nonnegative) coefficients.Note that polynomial matrices are not to be confused with monomial matrices, which are simply matrices with exactly one non-zero entry in each row and column.
If by λ we denote any element of the field over which we constructed the matrix, by I the identity matrix, and we let A be a polynomial matrix, then the matrix λI − A is the characteristic matrix of the matrix A. Its determinant, |λI − A| is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix A.
