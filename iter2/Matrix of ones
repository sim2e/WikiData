  Some sources call the all-ones matrix the unit matrix, but that term may also refer to the identity matrix, a different type of matrix.
A vector of ones or all-ones vector is matrix of ones having row or column form; it should not be confused with unit vectors.

Properties
For an n × n matrix of ones J, the following properties hold:

The  trace of J equals n, and the determinant equals 0 for n ≥ 2, but equals 1 if n = 1.
The characteristic polynomial of J is 
  
    
      
        (
        x
        −
        n
        )
        
          x
          
            n
            −
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x-n)x^{n-1}}
  .
The minimal polynomial of J is 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        −
        n
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x^{2}-nx}
  .
The rank of J is 1 and the eigenvalues are n with multiplicity 1 and 0 with  multiplicity n − 1.

J is the neutral element of the Hadamard product.When J is considered as a matrix over the real numbers, the following additional properties hold:

J is positive semi-definite matrix.
The matrix 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              1

        J
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{n}}J}
   is idempotent.
The matrix exponential of J is 
  
    
      
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        J
        )

              1
            
            n
          
        
        J
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \exp(J)=I+{\frac {e^{n}-1}{n}}J.}

Applications
The all-ones matrix arises in the mathematical field of combinatorics, particularly involving the application of algebraic methods to graph theory.  For example, if A is the adjacency matrix of an n-vertex undirected graph G, and J is the all-ones matrix of the same dimension, then G is a regular graph if and only if AJ = JA.  As a second example, the matrix appears in some linear-algebraic proofs of Cayley's formula, which gives the number of spanning trees of a complete graph, using the matrix tree theorem.
