There are thousands of terms that could be included in this category and the inclusion criteria can be fuzzy.  The working criteria being used, which can be disputed, is that terms included here...
refer to something about biology itself; for instance, not a branch of biology
are broadly applicable terms, not specific to a small subset of organisms
do not fit well into any other more specific existing terminology categoryAnatomical terms are not included here and appear in sub-categories of the main Anatomy category.
Initially, some alignment between this category and the article Glossary of biology was considered, but the inclusion criteria for the Glossary is substantially broader and encompasses terminology, concepts, objects and processes.
