Evolutionary systems are a type of system, which reproduce with mutation whereby the most fit elements survive, and  the less fit die down. One of the developers of the evolutionary systems thinking is Béla H. Bánáthy. Evolutionary systems are characterized by "moving equilibria and the dynamics of coevolutionary interactions which can not be foreseen ex ante." The study of evolutionary systems  is an important subcategory of Complex Systems research.
