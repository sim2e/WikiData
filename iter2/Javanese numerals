Javanese numerals (Javanese: ꦮꦶꦭꦁꦔꦤ꧀ꦗꦮ, romanized: Wilangan Jawa; Old Javanese: 𑼮𑼶𑼭𑼁, romanized: wilaṅ) are a set of numerals traditionally used in the Javanese language, although Arabic numerals are also used. Javanese numerals follow the Hindu–Arabic numeral system commonly used in the rest of the world.
Javanese language is rich in numerical expressions. What is written here is the form in standard written Javanese. Spoken Javanese or dialects can take different forms.

Numerals
Basic numerals
The numerals 0–9 have independent and modifier forms. The modifiers are used to form powers of 10 or modify the sum of object. In some cases, there is more than one word for a numeral reflecting the Javanese register system: ngoko (low-register) and krama (high-register).

Teen, tween, and thirty numerals
Like English, Javanese has compound forms for the teens; however, it also has a series of compound 'tweens', 21–29. The teens are based on a root wĕlas and the tweens on likur.
Especially for numerals between 30 and 40, there are two formats: proper form and shortened form (wancahan).

Powers of 10
When basic numbers are combined with powers of 10, the modifier is applied. The table below uses the modifier of one (sa-) as an example.

"Minus half" numerals
There are 3 words that mean "minus half of". The format is ka- + basic numerals + minus half numerals.

Specifically for the word bĕlah, it can be used for hundreds and above. Sasur only used for thirty and above.

Fractions
Fractions are made up of numerator (modifier form) + pra + denominator. Below is the example:

Special numerals
There are several forms of numbering that do not follow the pattern above. These special numerals can be combined with the powers of 10.

Examples
Old Javanese numerals
Old Javanese numerals have two sets of names: native names (from Austronesian) and loan names (from Sanskrit).

The word śūnya for zero was calqued into Arabic as صف sifr, meaning 'nothing', which became the term "zero" in many European languages via Medieval Latin zephirum.
