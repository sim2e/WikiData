Research
He is known for the Chen attractor, Lu Chen attractor, and other works on Multiscroll attractors. He conducts research on chaos, control theory, bifurcations, nonlinear dynamics, complex systems, etc.

Chen attractor
Chen discovered the Chen equations, a system of coupled differential equations that produce the Chen's attractor, a type of Lorenz attractor.
The equations that govern the Chen system are:
