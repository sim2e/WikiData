A Multitrack Turing machine is a specific type of multi-tape Turing machine. 
In a standard n-tape Turing machine, n heads move independently along n tracks. In a n-track Turing machine, one head reads and writes on all tracks simultaneously. A tape position in an n-track Turing Machine contains n symbols from the tape alphabet. It is equivalent to the standard Turing machine and therefore accepts precisely the recursively enumerable languages.

Proof of equivalency to standard Turing machine
This will prove that a two-track Turing machine is equivalent to a standard Turing machine. This can be generalized to a n-track Turing machine. Let L be a recursively enumerable language. Let M= 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        Q
        ,
        Σ
        ,
        Γ
        ,
        δ
        ,
        
          q
          
            0
          
        
        ,
        F
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle Q,\Sigma ,\Gamma ,\delta ,q_{0},F\rangle }
   be standard Turing machine that accepts L. Let M' is a two-track Turing machine. To prove M=M' it must be shown that M 
  
    
      
        ⊆
      
    
    {\displaystyle \subseteq }
   M' and M' 
  
    
      
        ⊆
      
    
    {\displaystyle \subseteq }
   M

  
    
      
        M
        ⊆
        
          M
          ′
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle M\subseteq M'}
  If the second track is ignored then M and M' are clearly equivalent. 

  
    
      
        
          M
          ′
        
        ⊆
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M'\subseteq M}
  The tape alphabet of a one-track Turing machine equivalent to a two-track Turing machine consists of an ordered pair. The input symbol a of a Turing machine M' can be identified as an ordered pair [x,y] of Turing machine M. The one-track Turing machine is:

        =

                2
              
            
            ]
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta \left(q_{i},[x_{1},x_{2}]\right)=\delta '\left(q_{i},[x_{1},x_{2}]\right)}
  
This machine also accepts L.
