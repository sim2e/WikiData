History
Davy Hoy
David "Davy" F. Hoy, an alumnus and longtime university registrar, served as the university's baseball advisor for thirty years at the start of the 20th century. He traveled south with the team for spring training each year. Hoy baseball field was built at his urging in 1922, and named for him in 1923. Hoy threw out the first pitch on the field; the ball he used is preserved in the Kroch Library collections. Hoy was injured in a 1929 bus accident in Virginia while riding with the baseball team, and he died in December 1930 at age 67. Cornell's fight song, Give My Regards to Davy references "Davy" Hoy prominently.
