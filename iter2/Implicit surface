In mathematics, an implicit surface is a surface in Euclidean space defined by an equation 

  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        )
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y,z)=0.}
  An implicit surface is the set of zeros of a function of three variables. Implicit means that the equation is not solved for x or y or z.
The graph of a function is usually described by an equation 
  
    
      
        z
        =
        f
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle z=f(x,y)}
   and is called an explicit representation. The third essential description of a surface is the parametric one: 

  
    
      
        (
        x
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
        ,
        y
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
        ,
        z
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t))}
  , where the x-, y- and z-coordinates of surface points are represented by three functions 
  
    
      
        x
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
        
        ,
        y
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
        
        ,
        z
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle x(s,t)\,,y(s,t)\,,z(s,t)}
   depending on common parameters 
  
    
      
        s
        ,
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle s,t}
  . Generally the change of representations is simple only when the explicit representation 
  
    
      
        z
        =
        f
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle z=f(x,y)}
   is given: 
  
    
      
        z
        −
        f
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle z-f(x,y)=0}
   (implicit), 
  
    
      
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        ,
        f
        (
        s
        ,
        t
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (s,t,f(s,t))}
   (parametric).

   (see diagram wineglass).For a plane, a sphere, and a torus there exist simple parametric representations. This is not true for the fourth example.
The implicit function theorem describes conditions under which an equation 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y,z)=0}
   can be solved (at least implicitly) for x, y or z. But in general the solution may not be made explicit. This theorem is the key to the computation of essential geometric features of a surface: tangent planes, surface normals, curvatures (see below). But they have an essential drawback: their visualization is difficult.
If 
  
    
      
        F
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        ,
        z
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle F(x,y,z)}
   is polynomial in x, y and z, the surface is called algebraic. Example 5 is non-algebraic.
Despite difficulty of visualization, implicit surfaces provide relatively simple techniques to generate theoretically (e.g. Steiner surface) and practically (see below) interesting surfaces.

Formulas
Throughout the following considerations the implicit surface is represented by an equation

  
    
      
        F

        x
        ,

        F
      
    
    {\displaystyle F}
   meets the necessary conditions of differentiability. The partial derivatives of

Smooth approximations of several implicit surfaces

    {\displaystyle \Pi }
  -surfaces  can be used to approximate any given smooth and bounded object in 
  
    
      
        
          R
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R^{3}}
   whose surface is defined by a single polynomial as a product of subsidiary polynomials. In other words, we can design any smooth object with a single algebraic surface. Let us denote the defining polynomials as 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            i

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{i}\in \mathbb {R} [x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}](i=1,\ldots ,k)}
  . Then, the approximating object is defined by the polynomial

  
    
      
        F
        (
        x

        r
        ∈
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle r\in \mathbb {R} }
   stands for the blending parameter that controls the approximating error.

Visualization of implicit surfaces
There are various algorithms for rendering implicit surfaces, including the marching cubes algorithm. Essentially there are two ideas for visualizing an implicit surface: One generates a net of polygons which is visualized (see surface triangulation) and the second relies on ray tracing which determines intersection points of rays with the surface. The intersection points can be approximated by sphere tracing, using a signed distance function to find the distance to the surface.
