Specialized computer hardware is often used to execute artificial intelligence (AI) programs faster, and with less energy, such as Lisp machines, neuromorphic engineering, event cameras, and physical neural networks. As of 2023, the market for AI hardware is dominated by GPUs.

Lisp machines
Lisp machines were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s to make Artificial intelligence programs written in the programming language Lisp run faster.

Dataflow architecture
Dataflow architecture processors used for AI serve various purposes, with varied implementations like the polymorphic dataflow Convolution Engine by Kinara (formerly Deep Vision), structure-driven dataflow by Hailo, and dataflow scheduling by Cerebras.

Component hardware
AI accelerators
Since the 2010s, advances in computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer. By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced central processing units (CPUs) as the dominant means to train large-scale commercial cloud AI. OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from Alex Net (2012) to Alpha Zero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute needed, with a doubling-time trend of 3.4 months.

Artificial Intelligence Hardware Components
Cеntral Procеssing Units (CPUs)
Evеry computеr systеm is built on cеntral procеssing units (CPUs). Thеy handle duties, do computations, and carry out ordеrs. Evеn if spеcializеd hardwarе is morе еffеctivе at handling AI activitiеs, CPUs arе still еssеntial for managing gеnеral computing tasks in AI systеms.
