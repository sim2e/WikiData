In quantum computing, the quantum phase estimation algorithm is a quantum algorithm to estimate the phase corresponding to an eigenvalue of a given unitary operator. Because the eigenvalues of a unitary operator always have unit modulus, they are characterized by their phase, and therefore the algorithm can be equivalently described as retrieving either the phase or the eigenvalue itself. The algorithm was initially introduced by Alexei Kitaev in 1995.: 246 Phase estimation is frequently used as a subroutine in other quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm,: 131  the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, and the quantum counting algorithm.

Formal description of the problem
Let 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   be a unitary operator acting on an 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
  -qubit register. Unitarity implies that all the eigenvalues of 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   have unit modulus, and can therefore be characterized by their phase. Thus if 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
   is an eigenvector of 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
  , then 
  
    
      
        U
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
        =
        
          e
          
            2
            π
            i
            θ
          
        
        
          |
          ψ
          ⟩
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U|\psi \rangle =e^{2\pi i\theta }\left|\psi \right\rangle }
   for some 
  
    
      
        θ
        ∈
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta \in \mathbb {R} }
  . Due to the periodicity of the complex exponential, we can always assume 
  
    
      
        0
        ≤
        θ
        <
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq \theta <1}
  .
Our goal is to find a good approximation to 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   with a small number of gates and with high probability. The quantum phase estimation algorithm achieves this under the assumptions of having oracular access to 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
  , and having 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
   available as a quantum state.
More precisely, the algorithm returns an approximation for 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  , with high probability within additive error 
  
    
      
        ε
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varepsilon }

        1
        
          /
        
        ε
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(\log(1/\varepsilon ))}
   qubits (without counting the ones used to encode the eigenvector state) and 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        1
        
          /
        
        ε
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(1/\varepsilon )}
   controlled-U operations. Furthermore, we can improve the success probability to 
  
    
      
        1
        −
        Δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1-\Delta }
   for any 
  
    
      
        Δ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta >0}
   by using a total of 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        log
        ⁡

    {\displaystyle O(\log(1/\Delta )/\varepsilon )}
   uses of controlled-U, and this is optimal.

The algorithm
Setup
The input consists of two  registers  (namely, two parts): the upper 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   qubits comprise the first register, and the lower 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   qubits are the second register.
The initial state of the system is:

  
    
      
        
          |
        
        0
        
          ⟩
          
            ⊗
            n
          
        
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle |0\rangle ^{\otimes n}|\psi \rangle .}
  After applying n-bit  Hadamard gate operation

   on the first register, the state becomes:

          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
   such that 
  
    
      
        U

Measurement
Performing a measurement in the computational basis on the first register yields the outcome 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        y
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |y\rangle }
   with probabilityIt follows that 
  
    
      
        Pr
        ⁡
        (
        a
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Pr} (a)=1}
   if 
  
    
      
        δ
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta =0}
  , that is, when 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
   can be written as 
  
    
      
        θ
        =
        a
        
          /

    {\displaystyle \theta =a/2^{n}}
  , one always finds the outcome 
  
    
      
        y
        =
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle y=a}
  . On the other hand, if 
  
    
      
        δ
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta \neq 0}
  , the probability readsFrom this expression we can see that 
  
    
      
        Pr
        (
        a
        )
        ⩾

              π
              
                2
              
            
          
        
        ≈
        0.405
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Pr(a)\geqslant {\frac {4}{\pi ^{2}}}\approx 0.405}
   when 
  
    
      
        δ
        ≠
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta \neq 0}
  . To see this, we observe that from the definition of 
  
    
      
        δ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta }
   we have the inequality 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        δ

                  +

    {\displaystyle |\delta |\leqslant {\tfrac {1}{2^{n+1}}}}
  , and thus:: 157 : 348 
We conclude that the algorithm provides a good

    {\displaystyle 4/\pi ^{2}}
  . By adding a number of extra qubits on the order of

        ϵ
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(\log(1/\epsilon ))}
   and truncating the extra qubits the probability can increase to

Toy examples
Consider the simplest possible instance of the algorithm, where only

          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
  , is involved. Suppose the eigenvalue of 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ψ
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
   reads 
  
    
      
        λ
        =
        
          e

    {\displaystyle \lambda =e^{2\pi i\theta }}
  . The first part of the algorithm generates the one-qubit state 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ϕ
        ⟩
        ≡

        )
      
    
    {\textstyle |\phi \rangle \equiv {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|0\rangle +\lambda |1\rangle )}
  . Applying the inverse QFT amounts in this case to applying a Hadamard gate. The final outcome probabilities are thus 
  
    
      
        
          p

        )
      
    
    {\textstyle |\pm \rangle \equiv {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2}}}(|0\rangle \pm |1\rangle )}
  , or more explicitly,Suppose 
  
    
      
        λ
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =1}
  , meaning 
  
    
      
        
          |

        +

    {\displaystyle |\phi \rangle =|+\rangle }
  . Then 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            +

        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{-}=0}
  , and we recover deterministically the precise value of 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
   from the measurement outcomes. The same applies if 
  
    
      
        λ
        =
        −
        1

If on the other hand

  , then

        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{\pm }=[1\pm \cos(2\pi /3)]/2}
  , that is, 
  
    
      
        
          p

          /
        
        4
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{-}=3/4}
  . In this case the result is not deterministic, but we still find the outcome

        −
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |-\rangle }
   as more likely, compatibly with the fact that

    {\displaystyle 2/3}

More generally, if

  , then 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            +
          
        
        ≥

          /
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{+}\geq 1/2}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        θ

          /
        
        4
      
    
    {\displaystyle |\theta |\leq 1/4}
  . This is consistent with the results above because in the cases 
  
    
      
        λ
        =
        ±
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda =\pm 1}
  , corresponding to 
  
    
      
        θ

        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta =0,1/2}
  , the phase is retrieved deterministically, and the other phases are retrieved with higher accuracy the closer they are to these two.
