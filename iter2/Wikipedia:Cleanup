Barry Livingston - Just like Bobby Elder's filmography section that is in progress of being done, this should be in tables and possibly also organized better. Pahiy (talk) 00:14, 6 November 2023 (UTC)
Riverbend (Hudson County) - bare URLs in references. Tinton5 (talk) 07:24, 5 November 2023 (UTC) Fixed Jeraxmoira (talk) 13:06, 5 November 2023 (UTC)Balanced anesthesia - Feels(/felt) machine translated.

Pierre de Beaumont - bare URLs Lizardcreator (talk) 23:39, 30 October 2023 (UTC) Resolved by Jeraxmoira  — WILDSTARTALK 20:54, 3 November 2023 (UTC)
I guess I have partially fixed it. I am not able to create citations or verify the other bare references on that article Jeraxmoira (talk) 21:12, 3 November 2023 (UTC)Nextbook – formal revision required, chiefly as to references (notation, formatting).--Hildeoc (talk) 16:39, 28 October 2023 (UTC)

1990s is seemingly in its way to include all athletes, musicians and other people in the world. Thinker78 (talk) 00:56, 28 October 2023 (UTC)
Dharga Town is a mess. Horrid grammar, bad spelling, and is nigh incomprehensible at points. Needs a near total rewrite and much better sourcing. Grumpylawnchair (talk) 21:16, 23 October 2023 (UTC)
DJ Tocadisco - discography is very disorganized. Needs some organization. Lacon432 (talk) 15:45, 11 October 2023 (UTC)
Recognition of same-sex unions in India needs a rewrite for multiple issues, some of which I have raised in the talk page, along with sources and explanations. Some of the issues are as follows:Factual accuracy: For instance, the article inaccurately presents every same-sex wedding ceremony as common-law marriage. This is false, because "common-law marriage" is applicable only to those qualified to enter into a legal marriage and presently, same-sex couples are not qualified to enter into a legal marriage.
Neutrality: For instance, the article extensively discusses every protection order and habeas corpus case ruled in favour of the same-sex couple, contributing to the depth of detail and the quantity of text leading to undue weight.
Relevance of content: For instance, the article discusses almost every same-sex wedding ceremony reported in the news, which is neither legally recognised nor a party to the ongoing same-sex marriage case.
Wiki6995 (talk) 11:18, 3 October 2023 (UTC)The next month at the head of the cleanup category queue is July 2010. Some of the articles from that month's subcategory (all of which are listed below) might just need the cleanup tag removed. -- Beland (talk) 09:31, 2 October 2023 (UTC)

Bobby Edner – filmography should be in tables and organized better than as is. Lacon432 (talk) 04:15, 21 September 2023 (UTC)
 Partly done I added tables for the "Television series guest-starring roles" and "Voice work sections". Didn't have enough information to make a table for "Television Commercials" though. TizA35 (talk) 02:39, 4 October 2023 (UTC)

Tina Peters - edited by one editor and too much of one source that is biased. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Teenyplayspop (talk • contribs) 04:22, 22 August 2023 (UTC) Comment: - Hi! Please specify which Tina Peters you mean from the disambiguation page. Justanotherinternetguy ε=ε=ε=ε=┌(;￣▽￣)┘ talk 08:45, 24 August 2023 (UTC)Orange Jackets - Full of puffery, blatant promotion, and undue weight in the lead. In addition, the citations are a mess; they're all grouped together on the bottom and aren't inline. Grumpylawnchair (talk) 04:17, 22 August 2023 (UTC)
Update: I have fixed the citations and have also added more refs for the alumnae section. Jeraxmoira (talk) 08:24, 5 October 2023 (UTC)

Uma Preman. I disclosed payment in return of writing this article, so there is a tag asking for POV cleanup. I do not see much room for that, but would appreciate your help revising the article.Sabih omar 07:54, 2 August 2023 (UTC)
Vladimir Begun – thorough cleanup required.--Hildeoc (talk) 00:22, 22 July 2023 (UTC)
Carnival of Santiago de Cuba needs a rewrite for multiple issues, among which are remnants of past vandalism that slipped through multiple reversions. The lead section doesn't conform to standards, sources are given in publication-style instead of with references, there are too many quotations which are also overly long, and various other issues. 110521sgl (talk) 07:52, 3 July 2023 (UTC)These articles were tagged in June 2010, which is the second-oldest month in the cleanup queue. Some may simply need tags removed. -- Beland (talk) 23:23, 1 July 2023 (UTC)

Morgan Berry - tables are still a mess; dates and italics need to be implemented for better organization. Lacon432 (talk) 01:47, 26 May 2023 (UTC)
 Partly done. I organized them by year and italicized titles. I couldn't implement dates. Grumpylawnchair (talk) 22:16, 24 June 2023 (UTC)
Calvin Levels, Paul Benjamin, Len Lesser, Christopher Cazenove, David Ackroyd, Jo Anderson, Jade Yorker, Ingrid Torrance, Art Evans, J. Don Ferguson, Clint Walker, Tonea Stewart, Ramon Bieri, Lloyd Gough, Bill Nunn - filmography should be split between film credits and television credits. Lacon432 (talk) 01:47, 26 May 2023 (UTC)
Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis - there should be a table for her television credits and stage credits. For Ossie, a table for his credits should be done.Lacon432 (talk) 01:47, 26 May 2023 (UTC)
British Overseas Territories citizen - A lot of content has been introduced into the article which is not WP:POV. A lot of sections may not be relevant to BOTCs, or even off-topic. I propose the moderators remove non-POV passages, then check the passages in boxes, until the community have had a chance to discuss them. They look like they’ve been copied across from other British and Irish nationality articles. (Kreb (talk) 07:06, 8 May 2023 (UTC))Just to add to my earlier comment, it’s worth remembering that most British Overseas Territories are located in the Caribbean islands, and are much smaller than other former British colonies, which is why they haven’t become independent yet. There’s not much commonality between them and other colonies e.g. in Africa. So any passages relating to Ireland/Kenya/Uganda/India are simply not relevant. The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 is only loosely relevant: whilst it did lay down conditions on people from the territories entering the UK, it was not specifically aimed at them. (Kreb (talk) 07:12, 8 May 2023 (UTC))All the articles tagged for cleanup in April 2010 have been resolved, yay! Based on how quickly folks took care of those (many just needed the tag removed), I think we could probably accelerate resolution of end-of-queue articles from the current speed (about one month per year) to one month per month, which would mean the backlog wait time would stop growing. In that spirit, here are all the remaining articles that were tagged in May 2010:

Davie504 - I tried transcribing his name on IPA based on this YouTube video of his as source. I only used IPA characters present in Help:IPA/Italian. I would like the accuracy of my transcription to be verified or improved. Thank you. Kyleroo (talk) 00:39, 30 April 2023 (UTC)
Identity and language learning - written like an essay, with no lead section and an oversized "further reading" section, among several other major issues in this article. DM5 (talk) 21:31, 29 April 2023 (UTC)
Tatar confederation - same statements (e.g. "From the 10th to 13th centuries, Shatuo Turks joined Tatar confederation and became known as White Tatars branch of the Tatars.") repeated in multiple sections (e.g. in both "Name and origin" and "History") even though the article is relatively short.Erminwin (talk) 16:50, 28 April 2023 (UTC)
Jay Hickman - slight formatting issues in credit tables. Lacon432 (talk) 05:03, 18 April 2023 (UTC)
Kira Vincent-Davis - dates are out-of-order in tables. Lacon432 (talk) 05:03, 18 April 2023 (UTC)
 Partly done - tables are now sorted by year, but I was unable to find actual dates for most so I have not sorted within each year at all. Tollens (talk) 11:04, 21 April 2023 (UTC)
List of supermarket chains in Oceania - Incorrect grammar and formatting. Doctorkaufman (talk) 14:41, 4 April 2023 (UTC)

According to mass stats, this page got over a million page views per day in April, the highest among all articles currently tagged for cleanup. -- Beland (talk) 17:50, 16 May 2023 (UTC)
Solar Electric Light Fund Too much reliance on the subject's self-published webpage as a source. Sounds like an advertisment. The talk page has a detailed list of To-Do items and a list of better sources. BruceThomson (talk) 09:00, 22 April 2023 (UTC) Partly done: Most problems fixed, but needs to have more sources added. A good source list is on the talk page. BruceThomson (talk) 22:08, 5 May 2023 (UTC)

Pianolettuce (talk) 16:19, 2 December, 2022 (UTC) Partly done I've fixed some of the improperly formatted references with refill. TheManInTheBlackHat (talk) 22:08, 3 December 2022 (UTC)Sports analyst - Someone added a lot of great information earlier, but didn't cite their sources properly.
