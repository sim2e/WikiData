In linear algebra, a defective matrix is a square matrix that does not have a complete basis of eigenvectors, and is therefore not diagonalizable.  In particular, an n × n matrix is defective if and only if it does not have n linearly independent eigenvectors.  A complete basis is formed by augmenting the eigenvectors with generalized eigenvectors, which are necessary for solving defective systems of ordinary differential equations and other problems.
An n × n defective matrix always has fewer than n distinct eigenvalues, since distinct eigenvalues always have linearly independent eigenvectors.  In particular, a defective matrix has one or more eigenvalues λ with algebraic multiplicity m > 1 (that is, they are multiple roots of the characteristic polynomial), but fewer than m linearly independent eigenvectors associated with λ. If the algebraic multiplicity of λ exceeds its geometric multiplicity (that is, the number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with λ), then λ is said to be a defective eigenvalue.  However, every eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity m always has m linearly independent generalized eigenvectors.
A Hermitian matrix (or the special case of a real symmetric matrix) or a unitary matrix is never defective; more generally, a normal matrix (which includes Hermitian and unitary as special cases) is never defective.

Jordan block
Any nontrivial Jordan block of size

        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\times 2}
   or larger (that is, not completely diagonal) is defective.  (A diagonal matrix is a special case of the Jordan normal form with all trivial Jordan blocks of size

Any defective matrix has a nontrivial Jordan normal form, which is as close as one can come to diagonalization of such a matrix.

Example
A simple example of a defective matrix is

  
    
      
        
          
            [
            
              
                
                  3
                
                
                  1
                
              
              
                
                  0
                
                
                  3
                
              
            
            ]
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}3&1\\0&3\end{bmatrix}},}
  which has a double eigenvalue of 3 but only one distinct eigenvector

  
    
      
        
          
            [
            
              
                
                  1
