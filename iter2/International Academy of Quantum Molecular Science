The International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science (IAQMS) is an international scientific learned society covering all applications of quantum theory to chemistry and chemical physics. It was created in Menton in 1967. The founding members were Raymond Daudel, Per-Olov LÃ¶wdin, Robert G. Parr, John Pople and Bernard Pullman. Its foundation was supported by Louis de Broglie.Originally, the academy had 25 regular members under 65 years of age. This was later raised to 30, and then to 35. There is no limit on the number of members over 65 years of age. The members are "chosen among the scientists of all countries who have distinguished themselves by the value of their scientific work, their role of pioneer or leader of a school in the broad field of quantum chemistry, i.e. the application of quantum mechanics to the study of molecules and macromolecules". As of 2006, the academy consisted of 90 members. The academy organizes the International Congress of Quantum Chemistry every three years.
The academy awards a medal to a young member of the scientific community who has distinguished themselves by a pioneering and important contribution. The award has been made every year since 1967.
