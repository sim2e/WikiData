In mathematics, a totally positive matrix is a square matrix in which all the minors are positive: that is, the determinant of every square submatrix is a positive number.  A totally positive matrix has all entries positive, so it is also a positive matrix; and it has all principal minors positive (and positive eigenvalues). A symmetric totally positive matrix is therefore also positive-definite. A totally non-negative matrix is defined similarly, except that all the minors must be non-negative (positive or zero). Some authors use "totally positive" to include all totally non-negative matrices.

Definition
Let 
  
    
      
        
          A
        
        =
        (
        
          A
          
            i
            j
          
        
        
          )
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =(A_{ij})_{ij}}
  
be an n × n matrix. Consider any 
  
    
      
        p
        ∈
        {
        1
        ,
        2
        ,
        …
        ,
        n
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\in \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}}
   and any p × p submatrix of the form 
  
    
      
        
          B
        
        =
        (
        
          A
          
            
              i
              
                k
              
            
            
              j
              
                ℓ
              
            
          
        
        
          )
          
            k
            ℓ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} =(A_{i_{k}j_{\ell }})_{k\ell }}
  
where:

  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        
          i
          
            1
          
        
        <
        …
        <
        
          i
          
            p
          
        
        ≤
        n
        ,
        
        1
        ≤
        
          j
          
            1
          
        
        <
        …
        <
        
          j
          
            p
          
        
        ≤
        n
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq i_{1}<\ldots <i_{p}\leq n,\qquad 1\leq j_{1}<\ldots <j_{p}\leq n.}
  Then A is a totally positive matrix if:

  
    
      
        det
        (
        
          B
        
        )
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \det(\mathbf {B} )>0}
  for all submatrices 
  
    
      
        
          B
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} }
   that can be formed this way.

History
Topics which historically led to the development of the theory of total positivity include the study of:
the spectral properties of kernels and matrices which are totally positive,
ordinary differential equations whose Green's function is totally positive (by M. G. Krein and some colleagues in the mid-1930s),
the variation diminishing properties (started by I. J. Schoenberg in 1930),
Pólya frequency functions (by I. J. Schoenberg in the late 1940s and early 1950s).

Examples
For example, a Vandermonde matrix whose nodes are positive and increasing is a totally positive matrix.
