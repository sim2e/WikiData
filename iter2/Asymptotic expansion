In mathematics, an asymptotic expansion, asymptotic series or Poincaré expansion (after Henri Poincaré) is a formal series of functions which has the property that truncating the series after a finite number of terms provides an approximation to a given function as the argument of the function tends towards a particular, often infinite, point. Investigations by Dingle (1973) revealed that the divergent part of an asymptotic expansion is latently meaningful, i.e. contains information about the exact value of the expanded function.
The most common type of asymptotic expansion is a power series in either positive or negative powers. Methods of generating such expansions include the Euler–Maclaurin summation formula and integral transforms such as the Laplace and Mellin transforms. Repeated integration by parts will often lead to an asymptotic expansion.
Since a convergent Taylor series fits the definition of asymptotic expansion as well, the phrase "asymptotic series" usually implies a non-convergent series. Despite non-convergence, the asymptotic expansion is useful when truncated to a finite number of terms. The approximation may provide benefits by being more mathematically tractable than the function being expanded, or by an increase in the speed of computation of the expanded function. Typically, the best approximation is given when the series is truncated at the smallest term. This way of optimally truncating an asymptotic expansion is known as superasymptotics. The error is then typically of the form ~ exp(−c/ε) where ε is the expansion parameter. The error is thus beyond all orders in the expansion parameter. It is possible to improve on the superasymptotic error, e.g. by employing resummation methods such as Borel resummation to the divergent tail. Such methods are often referred to as hyperasymptotic approximations.

Formal definition
First we define an asymptotic scale, and then give the formal definition of an asymptotic expansion.
If 
  
    
      
         
        
          φ
          
            n
          
        
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \varphi _{n}\ }
   is a sequence of continuous functions on some domain, and if 
  
    
      
         
        L
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ L\ }
   is a limit point of the domain, then the sequence constitutes an asymptotic scale if for every n,

        L
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ L\ }
   may be taken to be infinity.) In other words, a sequence of functions is an asymptotic scale if each function in the sequence grows strictly slower (in the limit 
  
    
      
         
        x
        →

  In contrast to a convergent series for

        N

        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle N\to \infty }
  , one can think of the asymptotic series as converging for fixed

Worked example
Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its domain of convergence. Thus, for example, one may start with the ordinary series

        =
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{1-w}}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }w^{n}.}
  The expression on the left is valid on the entire complex plane 
  
    
      
        w
        ≠

  , while the right hand side converges only for

   results in the asymptotic expansion given earlier in this article.

Integration by parts
Using integration by parts, we can obtain an explicit formulaFor any fixed 
  
    
      
        z
      
    
    {\displaystyle z}
  , the absolute value of the error term

    {\displaystyle |e_{n}(z)|}
   decreases, then increases. The minimum occurs at 
  
    
      
        n
        ∼

    {\displaystyle \vert e_{n}(z)\vert \leq {\sqrt {\frac {2\pi }{\vert z\vert }}}e^{-\vert z\vert }}
  . This bound is said to be "asymptotics beyond all orders".

Properties
Uniqueness for a given asymptotic scale
For a given asymptotic scale 
  
    
      
        {
        
          φ
          
            n
          
        
        (
        x
        )
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\varphi _{n}(x)\}}
   the asymptotic expansion of function 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)}
   is unique. That is the coefficients 
  
    
      
        {
        
          a
          
            n
          
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{a_{n}\}}
   are uniquely determined in the following way:

where 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is the limit point of this asymptotic expansion (may be 
  
    
      
        ±
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pm \infty }
  ).

Non-uniqueness for a given function
A given function 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)}
   may have many asymptotic expansions (each with a different asymptotic scale).

Subdominance
An asymptotic expansion may be an asymptotic expansion to more than one function.
