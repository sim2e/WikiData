Pedro Domingos is a Professor Emeritus of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. He is a researcher in machine learning known for Markov logic network enabling uncertain inference.

Education
Domingos received an undergraduate degree and Master of Science degree from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST). He moved to the University of California, Irvine, where he received a Master of Science degree and followed by PhD.

Research and career
After spending two years as an assistant professor at IST, he joined the University of Washington as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering in 1999 and became a full professor in 2012. He started a machine learning research group at the hedge fund D. E. Shaw & Co. in 2018, but left in 2019.
