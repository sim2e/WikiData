In computational complexity, the logarithmic time hierarchy (LH) is the complexity class of all computational problems solvable in a logarithmic amount of computation time on an alternating Turing machine with a bounded number of alternations. It is a particular case of a bounded alternating Turing machine hierarchy. It is equal to FO and to FO-uniform AC0.The
