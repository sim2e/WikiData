Leo Anthony Harrington (born May 17, 1946) is a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley who works in 
recursion theory, model theory, and set theory.
Having retired from being a Mathematician, Professor Leo Harrington is now a Philosopher.His notable results include proving the Parisâ€“Harrington theorem along with Jeff Paris,
showing that if the axiom of determinacy holds for all analytic sets then x# exists for all reals x,
and proving with Saharon Shelah that the first-order theory of the partially ordered set of recursively enumerable Turing degrees is undecidable.
