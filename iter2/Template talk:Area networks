I wanted to bring up an edit which included the following Wanted pages:

Building area network (earlier I turned this into a redirect)
Neighborhood area network
Industrial area network (currently linked from Internet area network as a disambiguation) - some potential sources: [1], [2]
Field area network
Local metrological network - this one's an earlier item that was commented out.As a result of subsequent edits I went ahead and commented out all remaining red links from the template for aesthetic reasons.  I'm bringing this topic into the talk page for more practical reasons:  Do these topics have sufficient supporting reference materials to make proper articles?  Or would it be better to simply remove all the unused entries?  A quick search revealed some potential articles for one topic (listed above) but I don't generally start new articles on Wikipedia, so I'm bringing the topic out to the general community.  --Stux (talk) 21:44, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
