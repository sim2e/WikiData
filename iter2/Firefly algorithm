In mathematical optimization, the firefly algorithm is a metaheuristic proposed by Xin-She Yang and inspired by the flashing behavior of fireflies.

Algorithm
In pseudocode the algorithm can be stated as:

Begin
    1) Objective function: 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          x
        
        )
        ,
        
        
          x
        
        =
        (
        
          x
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
        ,
        .
        .
        .
        ,
        
          x
          
            d
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} ),\quad \mathbf {x} =(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{d})}
  ;
    2) Generate an initial population of fireflies 
  
    
      
        
          
            x
          
          
            i
          
        
        
        (
        i
        =
        1
        ,
        2
        ,
        …
        ,
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} _{i}\quad (i=1,2,\dots ,n)}
  ;.
    3) Formulate light intensity I so that it is associated with 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        
          x
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} )}
  
       (for example, for maximization problems, 
  
    
      
        I
        ∝
        f
        (
        
          x
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle I\propto f(\mathbf {x} )}
   or simply 
  
    
      
        I
        =
        f
        (
        
          x
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle I=f(\mathbf {x} )}
  ;)
    4) Define absorption coefficient γ

    while (t < MaxGeneration)
        for i = 1 : n (all n fireflies)
            for j = 1 : i (n fireflies)
                if (
  
    
      
        
          I
          
            j
          
        
        >
        
          I
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle I_{j}>I_{i}}
  ),
                    Vary attractiveness with distance r via 
  
    
      
        exp
        ⁡
        (
        −
        γ
        
        r
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \exp(-\gamma \;r)}
  ;
                    move firefly i towards j;                
                    Evaluate new solutions and update light intensity;
                end if 
            end for j
        end for i
        Rank fireflies and find the current best;
    end while
end

Note that the number of objective function evaluations per loop is one evaluation per firefly, even though the above pseudocode suggests it is n×n. (Based on Yang's MATLAB code.) Thus the total number of objective function evaluations is (number of generations) × (number of fireflies).
The main update formula for any pair of two fireflies 
  
    
      
        
          
            x
          
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} _{i}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            x
          
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} _{j}}
   is

  
    
      
        
          
            x
          
          
            i
          
          
            t
            +
            1
          
        
        =
        
          
            x
          
          
            i
          
          
            t
          
        
        +
        β
        exp
        ⁡
        [
        −
        γ
        
          r
          
            i
            j
          
          
            2
          
        
        ]
        (
        
          
            x
          
          
            j
          
          
            t
          
        
        −
        
          
            x
          
          
            i
          
          
            t
          
        
        )
        +
        
          α
          
            t
          
        
        
          
            ϵ
          
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} _{i}^{t+1}=\mathbf {x} _{i}^{t}+\beta \exp[-\gamma r_{ij}^{2}](\mathbf {x} _{j}^{t}-\mathbf {x} _{i}^{t})+\alpha _{t}{\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}_{t}}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          α
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha _{t}}
   is a parameter controlling the step size, while 
  
    
      
        
          
            ϵ
          
          
            t
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}_{t}}
   is a vector drawn from a Gaussian or other
distribution.zae
It can be shown that the limiting case 
  
    
      
        γ
        →
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma \rightarrow 0}
   corresponds to the standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In fact, if the inner loop (for j) is removed and the brightness 
  
    
      
        
          I
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle I_{j}}
   is replaced by the current global best 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{*}}
  , then FA essentially becomes the standard PSO.

Criticism
Nature-inspired metaheuristics in general have attracted criticism in the research community for hiding their lack of novelty behind metaphors.  The firefly algorithm has been criticized as differing from the well-established particle swarm optimization only in a negligible way.
