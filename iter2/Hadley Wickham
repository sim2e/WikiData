Hadley Alexander Wickham (born 14 October 1979) is a New Zealand statistician known for his work on open-source software for the R statistical programming environment. He is the chief scientist at Posit, PBC and an adjunct professor of statistics at the University of Auckland, Stanford University, and Rice University. His work includes the data visualisation system ggplot2 and the tidyverse, a collection of R packages for data science based on the concept of tidy data.

Education and career
Wickham was born in Hamilton, New Zealand. He received a Bachelors degree in Human Biology and a masters degree in statistics at the University of Auckland in 1999–2004 and his PhD at Iowa State University in 2008 supervised by Di Cook and Heike Hofmann. He is the chief scientist at Posit, PBC (formerly RStudio) and an adjunct professor of statistics at the University of Auckland, Stanford University, and Rice University.Wickham is a prominent and active member of the R user community and has developed several notable and widely used packages including ggplot2, plyr, dplyr, and reshape2. Wickham's data analysis packages for R are collectively known as the tidyverse. According to Wickham's tidy data approach, each variable should be a column, each observation should be a row, and each type of observational unit should be a table.

Honors and awards
In 2006 he was awarded the John Chambers Award for Statistical Computing for his work developing tools for data reshaping and visualisation. Wickham was named a Fellow by the American Statistical Association in 2015 for "pivotal contributions to statistical practice through innovative and pioneering research in statistical graphics and computing". Wickham was awarded the international COPSS Presidents' Award in 2019 for "influential work in statistical computing, visualisation, graphics, and data analysis" including "making statistical thinking and computing accessible to a large audience".

Personal life
Wickham's sister Charlotte Wickham is also a statistician.
