Marcelo Miranda Viana da Silva (born 4 March 1962) is a Brazilian mathematician working in dynamical systems theory.He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1993. He received the TWAS Prize in 1998 and in 2005 he was awarded the inaugural ICTP Ramanujan Prize for his research achievements.Viana was vice-president of the International Mathematical Union in 2011–2014, and president of the Brazilian Mathematical Society (2013–2015).In 1998, he was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians, in Berlin.Viana is director elected of the IMPA (for the period 2016–2019).
Viana is a columnist for Folha de S.Paulo.He is the chair of the executive committee for the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians, Rio de Janeiro.
