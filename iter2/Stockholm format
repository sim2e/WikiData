Stockholm format is a multiple sequence alignment format used by Pfam, Rfam and Dfam, to disseminate protein, RNA and DNA sequence alignments. The alignment editors Ralee, Belvu and Jalview support Stockholm format as do the probabilistic database search tools, Infernal and HMMER, and the phylogenetic analysis tool Xrate. Stockholm format files often have the filename extension .sto or .stk.

Syntax
A well-formed stockholm file always contains a header which states the format and version identifier, currently '# STOCKHOLM 1.0'. The header is then followed by a multiple lines, a mix of markup (starting with #) and sequences. Finally, the "//" line indicates the end of the alignment.
An example without markup looks like:

# STOCKHOLM 1.0
#=GF ID   EXAMPLE
<seqname> <aligned sequence>
<seqname> <aligned sequence>
<seqname> <aligned sequence>
//

Sequences are written one per line. The sequence name is written first, and after any number of whitespaces the sequence is written. Sequence names are typically in the form "name/start-end" or just "name". Sequence letters may include any characters except whitespace. Gaps may be indicated by "." or "-".
Mark-up lines start with #. The "parameters" are separated by whitespace, so an underscore ("_") instead of space should be used for the 1-char-per-column markups. Mark-up types defined include:

#=GF <feature> <Generic per-File annotation, free text>
#=GC <feature> <Generic per-Column annotation, exactly 1 char per column>
#=GS <seqname> <feature> <Generic per-Sequence annotation, free text>
#=GR <seqname> <feature> <Generic per-Residue annotation, exactly 1 char per residue>

Recommended features
These feature names are used by Pfam and Rfam for specific types of annotation. 
(See the Pfam and the Rfam documentation under "Description of fields")

            (2) cWW is equivalent to SS.

#=GC
The list of valid features includes those shown below, as well as the same features as for #=GR with "_cons" appended, meaning "consensus". Example: "SS_cons".

      Feature   Description            Description
      -------   -----------            --------------
      RF        ReFerence annotation   Often the consensus RNA or protein sequence is used as a reference
                                       Any non-gap character (e.g. x's) can indicate consensus/conserved/match columns
                                       .'s or -'s indicate insert columns
                                       ~'s indicate unaligned insertions
                                       Upper and lower case can be used to discriminate strong and weakly conserved 
                                       residues respectively
      MM        Model Mask             Indicates which columns in an alignment should be masked, such
                                       that the emission probabilities for match states corresponding to
                                       those columns will be the background distribution.

Notes
Do not use multiple lines with the same #=GC label.
For a single sequence, do not use multiple lines with the same #=GR label. Only one unique feature assignment can be made for each sequence.
"X" in SA and SS means "residue with unknown structure".
The protein SS letters are taken from DSSP: H=alpha-helix, G=3/10-helix, I=p-helix, E=extended strand, B=residue in isolated b-bridge, T=turn, S=bend, C=coil/loop.)
The RNA SS letters are taken from WUSS (Washington University Secondary Structure) notation. Matching nested parentheses characters <>, (), [], or {} indicate a basepair. The symbols '.', ',' and ';' indicate unpaired regions. Matched upper and lower case characters from the English alphabet indicate pseudoknot interactions. The 5' nucleotide within the knot should be in uppercase and the 3' nucleotide lowercase.

Recommended placements
#=GF Above the alignment
#=GC Below the alignment
#=GS Above the alignment or just below the corresponding sequence
#=GR Just below the corresponding sequence

Size limits
There are no explicit size limits on any field. However, a simple parser that uses fixed field sizes should work safely on Pfam and Rfam alignments with these limits:

Line length: 10000.
<seqname>: 255.
<feature>: 255.

Examples
A simple example of an Rfam alignment (UPSK RNA) with a pseudoknot in Stockholm format is shown below:
