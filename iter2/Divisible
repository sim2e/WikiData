In mathematics, a divisor of an integer 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , also called a factor of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , is an integer 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   that may be multiplied by some integer to produce 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  . In this case, one also says that 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is a multiple of 
  
    
      
        m
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m.}
   An integer 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is divisible or evenly divisible by another integer 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   if 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   is a divisor of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  ; this implies dividing 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   by 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   leaves no remainder.

Definition
An integer n is divisible by a nonzero integer m if there exists an integer k such that 
  
    
      
        n
        =
        k
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=km}
  . This is written as

  
    
      
        m
        ∣
        n
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\mid n.}
  Other ways of saying the same thing are that m divides n, m is a divisor of n, m is a factor of n, and n is a multiple of m. If m does not divide n, then the notation is 
  
    
      
        m
        ∤
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\not \mid n}
  .Usually, m is required to be nonzero, but n is allowed to be zero. With this convention, 
  
    
      
        m
        ∣
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m\mid 0}
   for every nonzero integer m. Some definitions omit the requirement that 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   be nonzero.

General
Divisors can be negative as well as positive, although often the term is restricted to positive divisors. For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, −1, −2, and −4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned.
1 and −1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself. Integers divisible by 2 are called even, and integers not divisible by 2 are called odd.
1, −1, n and −n are known as the trivial divisors of n. A divisor of n that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor (or strict divisor). A nonzero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number, while the units −1 and 1 and prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors.
There are divisibility rules that allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits.

Examples
7 is a divisor of 42 because 
  
    
      
        7
        ×
        6
        =
        42
      
    
    {\displaystyle 7\times 6=42}
  , so we can say 
  
    
      
        7
        ∣
        42
      
    
    {\displaystyle 7\mid 42}
  . It can also be said that 42 is divisible by 7, 42 is a multiple of 7, 7 divides 42, or 7 is a factor of 42.
The non-trivial divisors of 6 are 2, −2, 3, −3.
The positive divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.

    {\displaystyle A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60\}}
  , partially ordered by divisibility, has the Hasse diagram:

Further notions and facts
There are some elementary rules:

If 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid b}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
        ∣
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\mid c}
  , then 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid c}
  , i.e. divisibility is a transitive relation.
If 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid b}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
        ∣
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\mid a}
  , then 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=b}
   or 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        −
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=-b}
  .
If 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid b}
   and 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid c}
  , then 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        (
        b
        +
        c
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid (b+c)}
   holds, as does 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        (
        b
        −
        c
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid (b-c)}
  . However, if 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid b}
   and 
  
    
      
        c
        ∣
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle c\mid b}
  , then 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        +
        c
        )
        ∣
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a+c)\mid b}
   does not always hold (e.g. 
  
    
      
        2
        ∣
        6
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2\mid 6}
   and 
  
    
      
        3
        ∣
        6
      
    
    {\displaystyle 3\mid 6}
   but 5 does not divide 6).If 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        b
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid bc}
  , and 
  
    
      
        gcd
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gcd(a,b)=1}
  , then 
  
    
      
        a
        ∣
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\mid c}
  . This is called Euclid's lemma.
If 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   is a prime number and 
  
    
      
        p
        ∣
        a
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\mid ab}
   then 
  
    
      
        p
        ∣
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\mid a}
   or 
  
    
      
        p
        ∣
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\mid b}
  .
A positive divisor of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   that is different from 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is called a proper divisor or an aliquot part of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  . A number that does not evenly divide 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   but leaves a remainder is sometimes called an aliquant part of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  .
An integer 
  
    
      
        n
        >
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n>1}
   whose only proper divisor is 1 is called a prime number. Equivalently, a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive factors: 1 and itself.
Any positive divisor of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is a product of prime divisors of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   raised to some power. This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
A number 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is said to be perfect if it equals the sum of its proper divisors, deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , and abundant if this sum exceeds 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  .
The total number of positive divisors of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is a multiplicative function 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(n)}
  , meaning that when two numbers 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   and 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   are relatively prime, then 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        m
        n
        )
        =
        d

        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n)}
  . For instance, 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        42
        )

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(42)=8=2\times 2\times 2=d(2)\times d(3)\times d(7)}
  ; the eight divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 42. However, the number of positive divisors is not a totally multiplicative function: if the two numbers 
  
    
      
        m
      
    
    {\displaystyle m}
   and 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   share a common divisor, then it might not be true that 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        m
        n
        )
        =

        m
        )
        ×
        d
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(mn)=d(m)\times d(n)}
  . The sum of the positive divisors of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is another multiplicative function

        (
        n
        )

One interpretation of this result is that a randomly chosen positive integer n has an average
number of divisors of about 
  
    
      
        ln
        ⁡
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ln n}
  . However, this is a result from the contributions of numbers with "abnormally many" divisors.

Ring theory
Division lattice
In definitions that include 0, the relation of divisibility turns the set 
  
    
      
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {N} }
   of non-negative integers into a partially ordered set that is a complete distributive lattice. The largest element of this lattice is 0 and the smallest is 1. The meet operation ∧ is given by the greatest common divisor and the join operation ∨ by the least common multiple. This lattice is isomorphic to the dual of the lattice of subgroups of the infinite cyclic group Z.
