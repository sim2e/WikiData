   It is also possible to define higher-dimensional gamma matrices. When interpreted as the matrices of the action of a set of orthogonal basis vectors for contravariant vectors in Minkowski space, the column vectors on which the matrices act become a space of spinors, on which the Clifford algebra of spacetime acts. This in turn makes it possible to represent infinitesimal spatial rotations and Lorentz boosts. Spinors facilitate spacetime computations in general, and in particular are fundamental to the Dirac equation for relativistic spin

   is not a proper member of the main set of four; it used for separating nominal left and right chiral representations.
The gamma matrices have a group structure, the gamma group, that is shared by all matrix representations of the group, in any dimension, for any signature of the metric. For example, the 2×2 Pauli matrices are a set of "gamma" matrices in three dimensional space with metric of Euclidean signature (3, 0). In five spacetime dimensions, the four gammas, above, together with the fifth gamma-matrix to be presented below generate the Clifford algebra.

Mathematical structure
The defining property for the gamma matrices to generate a Clifford algebra is the anticommutation relation

This defining property is more fundamental than the numerical values used in the specific representation of the gamma matrices.  Covariant gamma matrices are defined by

   is just the set of all 4×4 complex matrices, but endowed with a Clifford algebra structure. Spacetime is assumed to be endowed with the Minkowski metric ημν. A space of bispinors, Ux , is also assumed at every point in spacetime, endowed with the bispinor representation of the Lorentz group. The bispinor fields Ψ of the Dirac equations, evaluated at any point x in spacetime, are elements of Ux (see below). The Clifford algebra is assumed to act on Ux as well (by matrix multiplication with column vectors Ψ(x) in Ux for all x). This will be the primary view of elements of

   If S belongs to a representation of the Lorentz group, then the induced action E ↦ S E S−1 will also belong to a representation of the Lorentz group, see Representation theory of the Lorentz group.
If S(Λ) is the bispinor representation acting on Ux of an arbitrary Lorentz transformation Λ in the standard (4 vector) representation acting on V, then there is a corresponding operator on

The notation is called the Feynman slash notation. The slash operation maps the basis eμ of V, or any 4 dimensional vector space, to basis vectors γμ. The transformation rule for slashed quantities is simply

   form a representation of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. This is a spin representation. When these matrices, and linear combinations of them, are exponentiated, they are bispinor representations of the Lorentz group, e.g., the S(Λ) of above are of this form. The 6 dimensional space the σμν span is the representation space of a tensor representation of the Lorentz group. For the higher order elements of the Clifford algebra in general and their transformation rules, see the article Dirac algebra. The spin representation of the Lorentz group is encoded in the spin group Spin(1, 3) (for real, uncharged spinors) and in the complexified spin group Spin(1, 3) for charged (Dirac) spinors.

Expressing the Dirac equation
In natural units, the Dirac equation may be written as

  
    
      
         
        
          (
          
            i
            
              γ
              
                μ
              
            
            
              ∂
              
                μ
              
            
            −
            m
          
          )

        =
        0
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \left(i\gamma ^{\mu }\partial _{\mu }-m\right)\psi =0\ }
  where 
  
    
      
         
        ψ
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \psi \ }
   is a Dirac spinor.
Switching to Feynman notation, the Dirac equation is

  
    
      
         
        (
        i
        
          ∂

Five dimensions
The Clifford algebra in odd dimensions behaves like two copies of the Clifford algebra of one less dimension, a left copy and a right copy. Thus, one can employ a bit of a trick to repurpose  i γ 5  as one of the generators of the Clifford algebra in five dimensions. In this case, the set {γ 0, γ 1, γ 2, γ 3, i γ 5} therefore, by the last two properties (keeping in mind that i 2 ≡ −1) and those of the ‘old’ gammas, forms the basis of the Clifford algebra in 5 spacetime dimensions for the metric signature (1,4).
In metric signature (4,1), the set {γ 0, γ 1, γ 2, γ 3, γ 5} is used, where the γ μ are the  appropriate ones for the (3,1) signature. This pattern is repeated for spacetime dimension 2n even and the next odd dimension 2n + 1 for all n ≥ 1. For more detail, see higher-dimensional gamma matrices.

Trace identities
The gamma matrices obey the following trace identities:

Proving the above involves the use of three main properties of the trace operator:

tr(A + B) = tr(A) + tr(B)
tr(rA) = r tr(A)
tr(ABC) = tr(CAB) = tr(BCA)

Normalization
The gamma matrices can be chosen with extra hermiticity conditions which are restricted by the above anticommutation relations however. We can impose

  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              γ
              
                0
              
            
            )
          
          
            †
          
        
        =
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(\gamma ^{0}\right)^{\dagger }=\gamma ^{0}}
  , compatible with 
  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              γ
              
                0
              
            
            )
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        
          I
          
            4
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(\gamma ^{0}\right)^{2}=I_{4}}
  and for the other gamma matrices (for k = 1, 2, 3)

  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              γ
              
                k
              
            
            )
          
          
            †
          
        
        =
        −
        
          γ
          
            k
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(\gamma ^{k}\right)^{\dagger }=-\gamma ^{k}}
  , compatible with 
  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              γ
              
                k
              
            
            )
          
          
            2
          
        
        =
        −
        
          I
          
            4
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(\gamma ^{k}\right)^{2}=-I_{4}.}
  One checks immediately that these hermiticity relations hold for the Dirac representation.
The above conditions can be combined in the relation

  
    
      
        
          
            (
            
              γ
              
                μ
              
            
            )
          
          
            †
          
        
        =
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
        
          γ
          
            μ
          
        
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left(\gamma ^{\mu }\right)^{\dagger }=\gamma ^{0}\gamma ^{\mu }\gamma ^{0}.}
  The hermiticity conditions are not invariant under the action 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            μ
          
        
        →
        S
        (
        Λ
        )
        
          γ
          
            μ

        S
        (
        Λ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle S(\Lambda )}
   is not necessarily a unitary transformation due to the non-compactness of the Lorentz group.

  which fails to hold in the Majorana basis, for example), up to an arbitrary phase factor. This is because although charge conjugation is an automorphism of the gamma group, it is not an inner automorphism (of the group). Conjugating matrices can be found, but they are representation-dependent.

          a

   is the charge conjugation matrix, which matches the Dirac version defined above.
The reason for making all gamma matrices imaginary is solely to obtain the particle physics metric (+, −, −, −), in which squared masses are positive. The Majorana representation, however, is real. One can factor out the 
  
    
      
         
        i
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ i\ }
   to obtain a different representation with four component real spinors and real gamma matrices.  The consequence of removing the 
  
    
      
         
        i
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ i\ }
   is that the only possible metric with real gamma matrices is (−, +, +, +).
The Majorana basis can be obtained from the Dirac basis above as

Cl1,3(C) and Cl1,3(R)
The Dirac algebra can be regarded as a complexification of the real algebra Cl1,3(
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  ), called the space time algebra:

  
    
      
        
          
            C
            l

        =

            ,
            3

          R
        
        )

          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Cl} _{1,3}(\mathbb {C} )=\mathrm {Cl} _{1,3}(\mathbb {R} )\otimes \mathbb {C} }
  Cl1,3(
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  ) differs from Cl1,3(
  
    
      
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
  ): in Cl1,3(
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
  ) only real linear combinations of the gamma matrices and their products are allowed.
Two things deserve to be pointed out. As Clifford algebras, Cl1,3(
  
    
      
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
  ) and Cl4(
  
    
      
        
          C
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }
  ) are isomorphic, see classification of Clifford algebras. The reason is that the underlying signature of the spacetime metric loses its signature (1,3) upon passing to the complexification. However, the transformation required to bring the bilinear form to the complex canonical form is not a Lorentz transformation and hence not "permissible" (at the very least impractical) since all physics is tightly knit to the Lorentz symmetry and it is preferable to keep it manifest.
Proponents of geometric algebra strive to work with real algebras wherever that is possible. They argue that it is generally possible (and usually enlightening) to identify the presence of an imaginary unit in a physical equation. Such units arise from one of the many quantities in a real Clifford algebra that square to −1, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.  Some of these proponents also question whether it is necessary or even useful to introduce an additional imaginary unit in the context of the Dirac equation.In the mathematics of Riemannian geometry, it is conventional to define the Clifford algebra Clp,q(
  
    
      
        
          R

   just a notational device to identify

    {\displaystyle \times _{\mathbb {Z} _{2}}}
   is entangling parity and charge conjugation in a manner suitable for relating the Dirac particle/anti-particle states (equivalently, the chiral states in the Weyl basis). The bispinor, insofar as it has linearly independent left and right components, can interact with the electromagnetic field. This is in contrast to the Majorana spinor and the ELKO spinor, which cannot (i.e. they are electrically neutral), as they explicitly constrain the spinor so as to not interact with the

    {\displaystyle S^{1}}
   part coming from the complexification.
However, in contemporary practice in physics, the Dirac algebra rather than the space-time algebra continues to be the standard environment the spinors of the Dirac equation "live" in.

Other representation-free properties
The gamma matrices are diagonalizable with eigenvalues 
  
    
      
        ±
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pm 1}
   for 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma ^{0}}
  , and eigenvalues 
  
    
      
        ±
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pm i}
   for 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma ^{i}}
  .

In particular, this implies that 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma ^{0}}
   is simultaneously Hermitian and unitary, while the 
  
    
      
        
          γ
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \gamma ^{i}}
   are simultaneously anti–Hermitian and unitary.
Further, the multiplicity of each eigenvalue is two.

More generally, if 
  
    
      
         
        
          γ

    {\displaystyle \ \gamma ^{\mu }X_{\mu }\ }
   is not null, a similar result holds. For concreteness, we restrict to the positive norm case

            μ
          
        
        
          p
          
            μ
          
        
        =
        p
        
        
        
        
          /
        
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ \gamma ^{\mu }p_{\mu }=p\!\!\!/\ }
   with 
  
    
      
         
        p
        ⋅
        p
        =
        
          m
          
            2

        0
         
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ p\cdot p=m^{2}>0~.}
   The negative case follows similarly.

In quantum field theory one can Wick rotate the time axis to transit from Minkowski space to Euclidean space. This is particularly useful in some renormalization procedures as well as lattice gauge theory. In Euclidean space, there are two commonly used representations of Dirac matrices:
