In graph theory, the Tutte matrix A of a graph G = (V, E) is a matrix used to determine the existence of a perfect matching: that is, a set of edges which is incident with each vertex exactly once.
If the set of vertices is 
  
    
      
        V
        =
        {
        1
        ,
        2
        ,
        …
        ,
        n
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle V=\{1,2,\dots ,n\}}
   then the Tutte matrix is an n × n matrix A with entries

  where the xij are indeterminates.  The determinant of this skew-symmetric matrix is then a polynomial (in the variables xij, i < j ): this coincides with the square of the pfaffian of the matrix A and is non-zero (as a polynomial) if and only if a perfect matching exists.  (This polynomial is not the Tutte polynomial of G.)
The Tutte matrix is named after W. T. Tutte, and is a generalisation of the Edmonds matrix for a balanced bipartite graph.
