In mathematics, a filter on a set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a family 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   of subsets such that: 

  
    
      
        X
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\in {\mathcal {B}}}
   and 
  
    
      
        ∅
        ∉
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \emptyset \notin {\mathcal {B}}}
  
if 
  
    
      
        A
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\in {\mathcal {B}}}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle B\in {\mathcal {B}}}
  , then 
  
    
      
        A
        ∩
        B
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\cap B\in {\mathcal {B}}}
  
If 
  
    
      
        A
        ,
        B
        ⊂
        X
        ,
        A
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle A,B\subset X,A\in {\mathcal {B}}}
  , and 
  
    
      
        A
        ⊂
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\subset B}
  , then 
  
    
      
        B
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle B\in {\mathcal {B}}}
  A filter on a set may be thought of as representing a "collection of large subsets", one intuitive example being the neighborhood filter. Filters appear in order theory, model theory, and set theory, but can also be found in topology, from which they originate. The dual notion of a filter is an ideal.
Filters were introduced by Henri Cartan in 1937 and as described in the article dedicated to filters in topology, they were subsequently used by Nicolas Bourbaki in their book Topologie Générale as an alternative to the related notion of a net developed in 1922 by E. H. Moore and Herman L. Smith. Order filters are generalizations of filters from sets to arbitrary partially ordered sets. Specifically, a filter on a set is just a proper order filter in the special case where the partially ordered set consists of the power set ordered by set inclusion.

Preliminaries, notation, and basic notions
In this article, upper case Roman letters like 
  
    
      
        S
        
           and 
        
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle S{\text{ and }}X}
   denote sets (but not families unless indicated otherwise) and 
  
    
      
        ℘
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \wp (X)}
   will denote the power set of 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
   A subset of a power set is called a family of sets (or simply, a family) where it is over 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   if it is a subset of 
  
    
      
        ℘
        (
        X
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \wp (X).}
   Families of sets will be denoted by upper case calligraphy letters such as 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        ,
        
          
            C
          
        
        ,
        
           and 
        
        
          
            F
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}},{\mathcal {C}},{\text{ and }}{\mathcal {F}}.}
   
Whenever these assumptions are needed, then it should be assumed that 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is non–empty and that 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        ,
        
          
            F
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}},{\mathcal {F}},}
   etc. are families of sets over 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
  
The terms "prefilter" and "filter base" are synonyms and will be used interchangeably.
Warning about competing definitions and notation
There are unfortunately several terms in the theory of filters that are defined differently by different authors. 
These include some of the most important terms such as "filter". 
While different definitions of the same term usually have significant overlap, due to the very technical nature of filters (and point–set topology), these differences in definitions nevertheless often have important consequences. 
When reading mathematical literature, it is recommended that readers check how the terminology related to filters is defined by the author. 
For this reason, this article will clearly state all definitions as they are used.  
Unfortunately, not all notation related to filters is well established and some notation varies greatly across the literature (for example, the notation for the set of all prefilters on a set) so in such cases this article uses whatever notation is most self describing or easily remembered.
The theory of filters and prefilters is well developed and has a plethora of definitions and notations, many of which are now unceremoniously listed to prevent this article from becoming prolix and to allow for the easy look up of notation and definitions. 
Their important properties are described later.
Sets operations
The upward closure or isotonization in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   of a family of sets 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        ⊆
        ℘
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq \wp (X)}
   is

and similarly the downward closure of 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              B
            
          
          
            ↓
          
        
        :=
        {
        S
        ⊆
        B
         
        :
         
        B
        ∈
        
          
            B
          
        
        
        }
        =
        
          ⋃
          
            B
            ∈
            
              
                B
              
            
          
        
        ℘
        (
        B
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}^{\downarrow }:=\{S\subseteq B~:~B\in {\mathcal {B}}\,\}=\bigcup _{B\in {\mathcal {B}}}\wp (B).}
  

Throughout, 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is a map and 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is a set.

Nets and their tails
A directed set is a set 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
   together with a preorder, which will be denoted by 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq \,}
   (unless explicitly indicated otherwise), that makes 
  
    
      
        (
        I
        ,
        ≤
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (I,\leq )}
   into an (upward) directed set; this means that for all 
  
    
      
        i
        ,
        j
        ∈
        I
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle i,j\in I,}
   there exists some 
  
    
      
        k
        ∈
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\in I}
   such that 
  
    
      
        i
        ≤
        k
        
           and 
        
        j
        ≤
        k
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\leq k{\text{ and }}j\leq k.}
   For any indices 
  
    
      
        i
        
           and 
        
        j
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle i{\text{ and }}j,}
   the notation 
  
    
      
        j
        ≥
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle j\geq i}
   is defined to mean 
  
    
      
        i
        ≤
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\leq j}
   while 
  
    
      
        i
        <
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle i<j}
   is defined to mean that 
  
    
      
        i
        ≤
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\leq j}
   holds but it is not true that 
  
    
      
        j
        ≤
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle j\leq i}
   (if 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq \,}
   is antisymmetric then this is equivalent to 
  
    
      
        i
        ≤
        j
        
           and 
        
        i
        ≠
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\leq j{\text{ and }}i\neq j}
  ).
A net in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a map from a non–empty directed set into 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
   
The notation

    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i\in I}}
   will be used to denote a net with domain 
  
    
      
        I
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle I.}
  

Warning about using strict comparison
If 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                i
              
            
            )
          
          
            i
            ∈
            I
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{i}\right)_{i\in I}}
   is a net and 
  
    
      
        i
        ∈
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\in I}
   then it is possible for the set 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            >
            i
          
        
        =
        
          {
          
            
              x
              
                j

            j
            ∈
            I
          
          }
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{>i}=\left\{x_{j}~:~j>i{\text{ and }}j\in I\right\},}
   which is called the tail of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   after 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
  , to be empty (for example, this happens if 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   is an upper bound of the directed set 
  
    
      
        I
      
    
    {\displaystyle I}
  ). 
In this case, the family 
  
    
      
        
          {
          
            
              x
              
                >
                i
              
            
             
            :
             
            i
            ∈
            I
          
          }
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left\{x_{>i}~:~i\in I\right\}}
   would contain the empty set, which would prevent it from being a prefilter (defined later). 
This is the (important) reason for defining 
  
    
      
        Tails
        ⁡
        
          (

              ∙
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Tails} \left(x_{\bullet }\right)}

Filters and prefilters
The following is a list of properties that a family 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   of sets may possess and they form the defining properties of filters, prefilters, and filter subbases. Whenever it is necessary, it should be assumed that 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        ⊆
        ℘
        (
        X
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq \wp (X).}
  

Many of the properties of 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   defined above and below, such as "proper" and "directed downward," do not depend on 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   so mentioning the set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is optional when using such terms. Definitions involving being "upward closed in 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
  " such as that of "filter on 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
  " do depend on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   so the set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   should be mentioned if it is not clear from context.

There are no prefilters on 
  
    
      
        X
        =
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle X=\varnothing }
   (nor are there any nets valued in 
  
    
      
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle \varnothing }
  ), which is why this article, like most authors, will automatically assume without comment that 
  
    
      
        X
        ≠
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\neq \varnothing }
   whenever this assumption is needed.

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}=\{X\}}
   is called the indiscrete or trivial filter on 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
   It is the unique minimal filter on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   because it is a subset of every filter on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  ; however, it need not be a subset of every prefilter on 
  
    
      
        X
        .

   is also called the degenerate filter on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   (despite not actually being a filter). It is the only dual ideal on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   that is not a filter on

Ultrafilters
There are many other characterizations of "ultrafilter" and "ultra prefilter," which are listed in the article on ultrafilters. Important properties of ultrafilters are also described in that article.

Any non–degenerate family that has a singleton set as an element is ultra, in which case it will then be an ultra prefilter if and only if it also has the finite intersection property. 
The trivial filter 
  
    
      
        {
        X
        }
        
           on 
        
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{X\}{\text{ on }}X}
   is ultra if and only if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a singleton set.
The ultrafilter lemma
The following important theorem is due to Alfred Tarski (1930).

A consequence of the ultrafilter lemma is that every filter is equal to the intersection of all ultrafilters containing it. 
Assuming the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel (ZF), the ultrafilter lemma follows from the Axiom of choice (in particular from Zorn's lemma) but is strictly weaker than it. The ultrafilter lemma implies the Axiom of choice for finite sets. If only dealing with Hausdorff spaces, then most basic results (as encountered in introductory courses) in Topology (such as Tychonoff's theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces and the Alexander subbase theorem) and in functional analysis (such as the Hahn–Banach theorem) can be proven using only the ultrafilter lemma; the full strength of the axiom of choice might not be needed.

Kernels
The kernel is useful in classifying properties of prefilters and other families of sets.

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}^{*}:={\mathcal {F}}\vee \{X\setminus \left(\ker {\mathcal {F}}\right)\}^{\uparrow X}}
   is a free (non–degenerate) filter.Finite prefilters and finite sets
If a filter subbase 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is finite then it is fixed (that is, not free); 
this is because 
  
    
      
        ker
        ⁡
        
          
            B
          
        
        =
        
          ⋂
          
            B
            ∈
            
              
                B
              
            
          
        
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ker {\mathcal {B}}=\bigcap _{B\in {\mathcal {B}}}B}
   is a finite intersection and the filter subbase 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   has the finite intersection property. 
A finite prefilter is necessarily principal, although it does not have to be closed under finite intersections.
If 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is finite then all of the conclusions above hold for any 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        ⊆
        ℘
        (
        X
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq \wp (X).}
   
In particular, on a finite set 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   there are no free filter subbases (and so no free prefilters), all prefilters are principal, and all filters on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   are principal filters generated by their (non–empty) kernels.
The trivial filter 
  
    
      
        {
        X
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{X\}}
   is always a finite filter on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is infinite then it is the only finite filter because a non–trivial finite filter on a set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is possible if and only if 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is finite. 
However, on any infinite set there are non–trivial filter subbases and prefilters that are finite (although they cannot be filters). 
If 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a singleton set then the trivial filter 
  
    
      
        {
        X
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{X\}}
   is the only proper subset of 
  
    
      
        ℘
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \wp (X)}
   and moreover, this set 
  
    
      
        {
        X
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{X\}}
   is a principal ultra prefilter and any superset 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
        ⊇
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\supseteq {\mathcal {B}}}
   (where 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
        ⊆
        ℘
        (
        Y
        )
        
           and 
        
        X
        ⊆
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\subseteq \wp (Y){\text{ and }}X\subseteq Y}
  ) with the finite intersection property will also be a principal ultra prefilter (even if 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   is infinite).

Characterizing fixed ultra prefilters
If a family of sets 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is fixed (that is, 
  
    
      
        ker
        ⁡
        
          
            B
          
        
        ≠
        ∅
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ker {\mathcal {B}}\neq \varnothing }
  ) then 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is ultra if and only if some element of 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is a singleton set, in which case 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   will necessarily be a prefilter. Every principal prefilter is fixed, so a principal prefilter 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is ultra if and only if 
  
    
      
        ker
        ⁡
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ker {\mathcal {B}}}
   is a singleton set.
Every filter on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   that is principal at a single point is an ultrafilter, and if in addition 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is finite, then there are no ultrafilters on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   other than these.The next theorem shows that every ultrafilter falls into one of two categories: either it is free or else it is a principal filter generated by a single point.

Finer/coarser, subordination, and meshing
The preorder 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq \,}
   that is defined below is of fundamental importance for the use of prefilters (and filters) in topology. For instance, this preorder is used to define the prefilter equivalent of "subsequence", where "
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
        ≥
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}\geq {\mathcal {C}}}
  " can be interpreted as "
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
   is a subsequence of 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  " (so "subordinate to" is the prefilter equivalent of "subsequence of"). It is also used to define prefilter convergence in a topological space. 
The definition of 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   meshes with 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}},}
   which is closely related to the preorder 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq ,}
   is used in Topology to define cluster points.

Stated in plain English, the prefilter of tails of a subsequence is always subordinate to that of the original sequence. 
To see this, let

    {\displaystyle C:=x_{\geq i}\in \operatorname {Tails} \left(x_{\bullet }\right)}

If a filter subbase is ultra then it is necessarily a prefilter, in which case the filter that it generates will also be ultra. A filter subbase

The relation

           on 
        
        Filters

        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}

Symmetry: 
For any 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        ⊆
        ℘

           if and only if

        =

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq \wp (X),{\mathcal {B}}\leq \{X\}{\text{ if and only if }}\{X\}={\mathcal {B}}.}
   
So the set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   has more than one point if and only if the relation

        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq \,{\text{ on }}\operatorname {Filters} (X)}
   is not symmetric.
Antisymmetry: 
If

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq {\mathcal {C}}{\text{ then }}{\mathcal {B}}\leq {\mathcal {C}}}
   but while the converse does not hold in general, it does hold if 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
   is a filter). 
Two filters are equivalent if and only if they are equal, which makes the restriction of

Missing from the above list is the word "filter" because this property is not preserved by equivalence. 
However, if 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        
           and 
        
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}{\text{ and }}{\mathcal {C}}}
   are filters on 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   then they are equivalent if and only if they are equal; this characterization does not extend to prefilters.
Equivalence of prefilters and filter subbases
If 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is a prefilter on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   then the following families are always equivalent to each other:

  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
  ;
the π–system generated by 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
  ;
the filter on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   generated by 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
  ;
and moreover, these three families all generate the same filter on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   (that is, the upward closures in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   of these families are equal).
In particular, every prefilter is equivalent to the filter that it generates. 
By transitivity, two prefilters are equivalent if and only if they generate the same filter. 
Every prefilter is equivalent to exactly one filter on 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   which is the filter that it generates (that is, the prefilter's upward closure). 
Said differently, every equivalence class of prefilters contains exactly one representative that is a filter. 
In this way, filters can be considered as just being distinguished elements of these equivalence classes of prefilters.A filter subbase that is not also a prefilter cannot be equivalent to the prefilter (or filter) that it generates. 
In contrast, every prefilter is equivalent to the filter that it generates. 
This is why prefilters can, by and large, be used interchangeably with the filters that they generate while filter subbases cannot. 
Every filter is both a π–system and a ring of sets.

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}

          N

   but no two of these families are equivalent; moreover, no two of the filters generated by these three filter subbases are equivalent/equal. This conclusion can be reached by showing that the π–systems that they generate are not equivalent. Unlike with

   every set in the π–system generated by

          Z
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} }
   as a subset, which is what prevents their generated π–systems (and hence their generated filters) from being equivalent. If 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}

   then all three families would be free and although the sets

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}_{\operatorname {closed} }{\text{ and }}{\mathcal {C}}_{\operatorname {open} }}

        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  ; however, this common filter would still be strictly coarser than the filter generated by

Images of prefilters
Let

   Many of the properties that

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   may have are preserved under images of maps; notable exceptions include being upward closed, being closed under finite intersections, and being a filter, which are not necessarily preserved.
Explicitly, if one of the following properties is true of 
  
    
      
        
          
            B

Filter properties: ultra, ultrafilter, filter, prefilter, filter subbase, dual ideal, upward closed, proper/non–degenerate.
Ideal properties: ideal, closed under finite unions, downward closed, directed upward.
Moreover, if

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}

        f

        g

Otherwise it is just a prefilter on 
  
    
      
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle Z}

    {\displaystyle f^{-1}({\mathcal {B}})}
   degenerate as well. The next characterization shows that degeneracy is the only obstacle. If

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is a prefilter then the following are equivalent:

  
    
      
        
          f

   meshes with 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(X)}
  
and moreover, if 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}({\mathcal {B}})}
   is a prefilter then so is 
  
    
      
        f
        
          (

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f\left(f^{-1}({\mathcal {B}})\right).}
  If

        Y

   This observation allows the results in this subsection to be applied to investigating the trace on a set.
Bijections, injections, and surjections
All properties involving filters are preserved under bijections. This means that if 
  
    
      
        
          
            B

        ℘
        (
        Y
        )
        
           and 
        
        g
        :
        Y
        →
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq \wp (Y){\text{ and }}g:Y\to Z}
   is a bijection, then 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is a prefilter (resp. ultra, ultra prefilter, filter on 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}

    {\displaystyle X,}
   filter subbase, π–system, ideal on 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   etc.) if and only if the same is true of 
  
    
      
        g
        (
        
          
            B
          
        
        )
        
           on 
        
        Z
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g({\mathcal {B}}){\text{ on }}Z.}
  A map 
  
    
      
        g
        :
        Y
        →
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle g:Y\to Z}
   is injective if and only if for all prefilters 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        
           on 
        
        Y
        ,
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}{\text{ on }}Y,{\mathcal {B}}}
   is equivalent to 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        g
        (
        
          
            B
          
        
        )
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{-1}(g({\mathcal {B}})).}
    The image of an ultra family of sets under an injection is again ultra.
The map 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   is a surjection if and only if whenever 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is a prefilter on 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   then the same is true of 
  
    
      
        
          f
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        
          
            B
          
        
        )
        
           on 
        
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle f^{-1}({\mathcal {B}}){\text{ on }}X}
   (this result does not require the ultrafilter lemma).

Subordination is preserved by images and preimages
The relation 
  
    
      
        
        ≤
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,\leq \,}
   is preserved under both images and preimages of families of sets. 
This means that for any families 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
        
           and 
        
        
          
            F
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}{\text{ and }}{\mathcal {F}},}
  
Moreover, the following relations always hold for any family of sets 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
  : 
where equality will hold if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is surjective. 
Furthermore,

If 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        ⊆
        ℘
        (
        X
        )
        
           and 
        
        
          
            C
          
        
        ⊆
        ℘
        (
        Y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\subseteq \wp (X){\text{ and }}{\mathcal {C}}\subseteq \wp (Y)}
   then
and 
  
    
      
        
          g
          
            −
            1
          
        
        (
        g

        )
        )
        ≤
        
          
            C
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle g^{-1}(g({\mathcal {C}}))\leq {\mathcal {C}}}
   where equality will hold if 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is injective.

For an example that uses this duality, suppose 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        X
        →
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:X\to Y}
   is a map and 
  
    
      
        Ξ
        ⊆
        ℘
        (
        Y
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi \subseteq \wp (Y).}
   Define

which contains the empty set if and only if 
  
    
      
        Ξ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi }
   does.  It is possible for 
  
    
      
        Ξ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi }
   to be an ultrafilter and for 
  
    
      
        
          Ξ
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi _{f}}
   to be empty or not closed under finite intersections (see footnote for example).  Although

            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi _{f}}
   does not preserve properties of filters very well, if 
  
    
      
        Ξ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi }
   is downward closed (resp. closed under finite unions, an ideal) then this will also be true for 
  
    
      
        
          Ξ
          
            f
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi _{f}.}
   Using the duality between ideals and dual ideals allows for a construction of the following filter.
     Suppose 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   is a filter on 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   and let 
  
    
      
        Ξ
        :=
        Y
        ∖
        
          
            B
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi :=Y\setminus {\mathcal {B}}}
   be its dual in 
  
    
      
        Y
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y.}
   If 
  
    
      
        X
        ∉
        
          Ξ
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\not \in \Xi _{f}}
   then 
  
    
      
        
          Ξ
          
            f
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Xi _{f}}
  's dual 
  
    
      
        X

            f

    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}}
   of all dense open subsets of a topological space is a proper π–system and a prefilter. If the space is a Baire space, then the set of all countable intersections of dense open subsets is a π–system and a prefilter that is finer than

Filters and nets
This section will describe the relationships between prefilters and nets in great detail because of how important these details are applying filters to topology − particularly in switching from utilizing nets to utilizing filters and vice verse − and because it to make it easier to understand later why subnets (with their most commonly used definitions) are not generally equivalent with "sub–prefilters".

Partially ordered net
The domain of the canonical net 
  
    
      
        
          Net

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Net} _{\mathcal {B}}}
   is in general not partially ordered. However, in 1955 Bruns and Schmidt discovered a construction that allows for the canonical net to have a domain that is both partially ordered and directed; this was independently rediscovered by Albert Wilansky in 1970. 
It begins with the construction of a strict partial order (meaning a transitive and irreflexive relation)

Subnets in the sense of Willard and subnets in the sense of Kelley are the most commonly used definitions of "subnet." 
The first definition of a subnet was introduced by John L. Kelley in 1955.Stephen Willard introduced his own variant of Kelley's definition of subnet in 1970. 
AA–subnets were introduced independently by Smiley (1957), Aarnes and Andenaes (1972), and Murdeshwar (1983); AA–subnets were studied in great detail by Aarnes and Andenaes but they are not often used.

Kelley did not require the map 
  
    
      
        h
      
    
    {\displaystyle h}
   to be order preserving while the definition of an AA–subnet does away entirely with any map between the two nets' domains and instead focuses entirely on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   − the nets' common codomain. 
Every Willard–subnet is a Kelley–subnet and both are AA–subnets.

AA–subnets have a defining characterization that immediately shows that they are fully interchangeable with sub(ordinate)filters. 
Explicitly, what is meant is that the following statement is true for AA–subnets:
     If 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        
           and 
        
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}{\text{ and }}{\mathcal {F}}}
   are prefilters then 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        ≤
        
          
            F
          
        
        
           if and only if 
        
        
          Net
          
            
              F
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\leq {\mathcal {F}}{\text{ if and only if }}\operatorname {Net} _{\mathcal {F}}}
   is an AA–subnet of 
  
    
      
        
        
          Net
          
            
              B
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\operatorname {Net} _{\mathcal {B}}.}
  
If "AA–subnet" is replaced by "Willard–subnet" or "Kelley–subnet" then the above statement becomes false. In particular, the problem is that the following statement is in general false:
     False statement: If 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
          
        
        
           and 
        
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}{\text{ and }}{\mathcal {F}}}
   are prefilters such that

            F
          
        
        
           then 
        
        
          Net
          
            
              F
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {B}}\leq {\mathcal {F}}{\text{ then }}\operatorname {Net} _{\mathcal {F}}}
   is a Kelley–subnet of 
  
    
      
        
        
          Net
          
            
              B
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \;\operatorname {Net} _{\mathcal {B}}.}
  
Since every Willard–subnet is a Kelley–subnet, this statement remains false if the word "Kelley–subnet" is replaced with "Willard–subnet".

The directed set

Consequently, any order–preserving map

Because of this, there can be no order preserving map

    {\displaystyle h(M)\geq i=\left(n+2,B_{n+2}\right),}

Consequently,

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Net} _{\mathcal {F}}}
   is not a Kelley–subnet of 
  
    
      
        
          Net
          
            
              B
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Net} _{\mathcal {B}}.}
  
If "subnet" is defined to mean Willard–subnet or Kelley–subnet then nets and filters are not completely interchangeable because there exists a filter–sub(ordinate)filter relationships that cannot be expressed in terms of a net–subnet relationship between the two induced nets. In particular, the problem is that Kelley–subnets and Willard–subnets are not fully interchangeable with subordinate filters. If the notion of "subnet" is not used or if "subnet" is defined to mean AA–subnet, then this ceases to be a problem and so it becomes correct to say that nets and filters are interchangeable. Despite the fact that AA–subnets do not have the problem that Willard and Kelley subnets have, they are not widely used or known about.
