The New World of English Words, or, a General Dictionary is an English dictionary compiled by Edward Phillips and first published in London in 1658. It was the first folio English dictionary.

Contents
As well as containing common words, the dictionary featured many unusual words, foreign terms, proper nouns and other specialist terms. In total, the original edition featured 11,000 entries, increasing to 17,000 by the fifth edition in 1696.It was later revised and enlarged by John Kersey in 1706, eventually containing 38,000 entries. Kersey had already compiled his own dictionary, A New English Dictionary, in 1702, and used this revised edition of The New World of English Words as the basis for his more concise Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum in 1708.

Plagiarism
At least half of the entries were copied directly, without permission, from Thomas Blount's Glossographia, which had been published a couple of years before. Blount responded by publishing A world of errors discovered in the Interpreter of Hard Words, written against Sir Edward Phillips book entitled A New World in 1673.
