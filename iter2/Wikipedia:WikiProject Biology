Welcome  to WikiProject Biology, a WikiProject for discussing biology-related articles, editing issues, projects, and guidelines. The purpose of this project is to provide common ground for editors working in all biology-related projects, for seeking advice or requesting help from a broader community of biology editors, and for coordinating the categorization of biology articles. Please join us for discussion!

WikiProject Biology serves as a metaproject coordinating multiple subprojects. As a whole, WikiProject Biology and its subprojects maintain tens of thousands of articles, categories, templates, and other pages. However, WikiProject Biology itself only directly tags articles which pertain to the science of biology as a whole, which are relevant across many disciplines, or in some cases those which represent the field of biology as a whole to the public.

Related WikiProjects
WikiProject Biology is a daughter project of WikiProject Science. We serve as a meta-project with several subprojects under our purview. The organization of these is presented below in a cladogram. WikiProject Molecular Biology is a proposed merger of WP:BIOP, WP:COMBIO, WP:GEN, and WP:MCB and their taskforces into a single project. This and other merges may change this diagram in the future. See discussion here.
To see activity levels and active editors for these projects, see the Wikiproject Directory tool and look for the project in question. Clicking on a project will give further information.

Article assessment
Assessment – the assessment unit, which provides information about Biology articles rated by quality and importance, and the project's criteria for article quality grading.

Category maintenance
(All stats updated August 15, 2023)
PetScan results (union) for number of articles in English Wikipedia by depth (# subcats deep): 1, 1,580; 2, 15,681; 3, 66,174; 4, 446,785.  There are deeper layers containing more articles
Many biology categories are in bad shape. They tend to fill up with articles on minor topics that are better placed in subcategories (or sub-subcategories, etc.). A little maintenance of the top category and 30 subcategories would go a long way towards keeping articles properly sorted. These are listed below.
Main category: Biology (39 C, 50 P) 

Contains over 445,000 articles in all as of August 15, 2023.Subcategories:
