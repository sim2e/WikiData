The image looks nice and is part of this template since its creation, but I wondered: why homunculus?  I see no mention in the history of biology article.  Thanks, —PaleoNeonate – 09:45, 13 June 2020 (UTC)

I recently created {{History of physics}} and I am working on Draft:Template:History of chemistry and [[Draft:Template:History of mathematics. However this template contains many articles that are not about history specifically or related articles like History of science which are just englobing the topic already. Also I think we could remove some links to obsolete theories, these are historically interesting but distract from the history articles. Institutions also seem off. Can we convene on similar topics that we want in these templates? ReyHahn (talk) 20:56, 2 November 2023 (UTC)
