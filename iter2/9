9 (nine) is the natural number following 8 and preceding 10.

Evolution of the Hindu–Arabic digit
Circa 300 BCE, as part of the Brahmi numerals, various Indians wrote a digit 9 similar in shape to the modern closing question mark without the bottom dot. The Kshatrapa, Andhra and Gupta started curving the bottom vertical line coming up with a 3-look-alike. The Nagari continued the bottom stroke to make a circle and enclose the 3-look-alike, in much the same way that the sign @ encircles a lowercase a. As time went on, the enclosing circle became bigger and its line continued beyond the circle downwards, as the 3-look-alike became smaller. Soon, all that was left of the 3-look-alike was a squiggle. The Arabs simply connected that squiggle to the downward stroke at the middle and subsequent European change was purely cosmetic.
While the shape of the glyph for the digit 9 has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a descender, as, for example, in .

The modern digit resembles an inverted 6. To disambiguate the two on objects and documents that can be inverted, they are often underlined. Another distinction from the 6 is that it is sometimes handwritten with two strokes and a straight stem, resembling a raised lower-case letter q. In seven-segment display, the number 9 can be constructed either with a hook at the end of its stem or without one. Most LCD calculators use the former, but some VFD models use the latter.

Mathematics
Nine is the fourth composite number, and the first composite number that is odd. Nine is the third square number (32), and the second non-unitary square prime of the form p2, and, the first that is odd, with all subsequent squares of this form odd as well. Nine has the even aliquot sum of 4, and with a composite number sequence of two (9, 4, 3, 1, 0) within the 3-aliquot tree. There are nine Heegner numbers, or square-free positive integers

Nine is the number of derangements of 4, or the number of permutations of four elements with no fixed points.9 is the fourth refactorable number, as it has exactly three positive divisors, and 3 is one of them.A number that is 4 or 5 modulo 9 cannot be represented as the sum of three cubes.If an odd perfect number exists, it will have at least nine distinct prime factors.9 is a Motzkin number, for the number of ways of drawing non-intersecting chords between four points on a circle.

   a product of Pierpont primes, a regular nonagon can be constructed with a regular compass, straightedge, and angle trisector.Also an enneagon, a regular nonagon is able to fill a plane-vertex alongside an equilateral triangle and a regular 18-sided octadecagon (3.9.18), and as such, it is one of only nine polygons that are able to fill a plane-vertex without uniformly tiling the plane.There are nine distinct uniform colorings of the triangular tiling and the square tiling, which are the two simplest regular tilings; the hexagonal tiling, on the other hand, has three distinct uniform colorings.
There are a maximum of nine semiregular Archimedean tilings by convex regular polygons, when including chiral forms of the snub hexagonal tiling.   
There are nine uniform edge-transitive convex polyhedra in three dimensions:

the five regular Platonic solids: the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, dodecahedron and icosahedron;
the two quasiregular Archimedean solids: the cuboctahedron and the icosidodecahedron; and
two Catalan solids: the rhombic dodecahedron and the rhombic triacontahedron, which are duals to the only two quasiregular polyhedra.Nine distinct stellation's by Miller's rules are produced by the truncated tetrahedron. It is the simplest Archimedean solid, with a total of four equilateral triangular and four hexagonal faces.
In four-dimensional space, there are nine paracompact hyperbolic honeycomb Coxeter groups, as well as nine regular compact hyperbolic honeycombs from regular convex and star polychora. There are also nine uniform demitesseractic (

In decimal
9 is the highest single-digit number in the decimal system.
A positive number is divisible by nine if and only if its digital root is nine:

9 × 2 = 18 (1 + 8 = 9)
9 × 3 = 27 (2 + 7 = 9)
9 × 9 = 81 (8 + 1 = 9)
9 × 121 = 1089 (1 + 0 + 8 + 9 = 18; 1 + 8 = 9)
9 × 234 = 2106 (2 + 1 + 0 + 6 = 9)
9 × 578329 = 5204961 (5 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 27; 2 + 7 = 9)
9 × 482729235601 = 4344563120409 (4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 9 = 45; 4 + 5 = 9)That is, if any natural number is multiplied by 9, and the digits of the answer are repeatedly added until it is just one digit, the sum will be nine.In base-

   have such a property, which makes 3 the only other number aside from 9 in decimal that shares this property. Another consequence of 9 being 10 − 1 is that it is a Kaprekar number.
There are other interesting patterns involving multiples of nine:

9 × 12345679 = 111111111
18 × 12345679 = 222222222
81 × 12345679 = 999999999The difference between a base-10 positive integer and the sum of its digits is a whole multiple of nine. Examples:

The sum of the digits of 41 is 5, and 41 − 5 = 36. The digital root of 36 is 3 + 6 = 9.
The sum of the digits of 35967930 is 3 + 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 3 + 0 = 42, and 35967930 − 42 = 35967888. The digital root of 35967888 is 3 + 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 54, 5 + 4 = 9.If dividing a number by the amount of 9s corresponding to its number of digits, the number is turned into a repeating decimal. (e.g. 274/999 = 0.274274274274...)
Casting out nines is a quick way of testing the calculations of sums, differences, products, and quotients of integers known as long ago as the 12th century.Six recurring nines appear in the decimal places 762 through 767 of π. (See six nines in pi).

Nine (九; pinyin: jiǔ) is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word "long-lasting" (久; pinyin: jiǔ).
Nine is strongly associated with the Chinese dragon, a symbol of magic and power. There are nine forms of the dragon, it is described in terms of nine attributes, and it has nine children. It has 117 scales – 81 yang (masculine, heavenly) and 36 yin (feminine, earthly). All three numbers are multiples of 9 (9 × 13 = 117, 9 × 9 = 81, 9 × 4 = 36) as well as having the same digital root of 9.
The dragon often symbolizes the Emperor, and the number nine can be found in many ornaments in the Forbidden City.
The circular altar platform (Earthly Mount) of the Temple of Heaven has one circular marble plate in the center, surrounded by a ring of nine plates, then by a ring of 18 plates, and so on, for a total of nine rings, with the outermost having 81 = 9 × 9 plates.

There are three verses that refer to nine in the Quran.

We surely gave Moses nine clear signs.1 ˹You, O  Prophet, can˺ ask the Children of Israel. When Moses came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “I really think that you, O  Moses, are bewitched.”
Note 1: The nine signs of Moses are: the staff, the hand (both mentioned in Surah Ta-Ha 20:17-22), famine, shortage of crops, floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood (all mentioned in Surah Al-A'raf 7:130-133). These signs came as proofs for Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Otherwise, Moses had some other signs such as water gushing out of the rock after he hit it with his staff, and splitting the sea.

Now put your hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished.2 ˹These are two˺ of nine signs for Pharaoh and his people. They have truly been a rebellious people.”
Note 2: Moses, who was dark-skinned, was asked to put his hand under his armpit. When he took it out it was shining white, but not out of a skin condition like melanoma.

And there were in the city nine ˹elite˺ men who spread corruption in the land, never doing what is right.
