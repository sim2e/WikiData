Since dynamical systems is more general than chaos theory (not all systems are chaotic), I was wondering if we should change the template title to 'Dynamical systems' instead.
I have created Template:Dynamical_systems so {{Dynamical systems}} can also be used. Walwal20 talk â–¾ contribs 20:14, 27 August 2020 (UTC)
