Journal of the European Mathematical Society is a monthly peer-reviewed mathematical journal.
Founded in 1999, the journal publishes articles on all areas of pure and applied mathematics.
Most published articles are original research articles but the journal also publishes survey articles. The journal has been published by Springer until 2003. Since 2004, it is published by the European Mathematical Society. The first editor-in-chief was Jürgen Jost, followed in 2004 by Haïm Brezis.
The journal was founded in order to promote interdisciplinary work within the mathematical community  and to preserve unity across pure and applied mathematics.
