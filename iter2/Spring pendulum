In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, an elastic pendulum (also called spring pendulum or swinging spring) is a physical system where a piece of mass is connected to a spring so that the resulting motion contains  elements of both a simple pendulum and a one-dimensional spring-mass system. The system exhibits chaotic behaviour and is sensitive to initial conditions. The motion of an elastic pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations.

Analysis and interpretation
The system is much more complex than a simple pendulum, as the properties of the spring add an extra dimension of freedom to the system.  For example, when the spring compresses, the shorter radius causes the spring to move faster due to the conservation of angular momentum. It is also possible that the spring has a range that is overtaken by the motion of the pendulum, making it practically neutral to the motion of the pendulum.

Lagrangian
The spring has the rest length 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{0}}
   and can be stretched by a length 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
  . The angle of oscillation of the pendulum is 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  . 
The Lagrangian 
  
    
      
        L
      
    
    {\displaystyle L}
   is: 

  
    
      
        L
        =
        T
        −
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle L=T-V}
  where 
  
    
      
        T
      
    
    {\displaystyle T}
   is the kinetic energy and 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   is the potential energy. 
Hooke's law is the potential energy of the spring itself:

  
    
      
        
          V
          
            k
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        k
        
          x
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{k}={\frac {1}{2}}kx^{2}}
  where 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is the spring constant.
The potential energy from gravity, on the other hand, is determined by the height of the mass. For a given angle and displacement, the potential energy is:

  
    
      
        
          V
          
            g
          
        
        =
        −
        g
        m
        (
        
          l
          
            0
          
        
        +
        x
        )
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{g}=-gm(l_{0}+x)\cos \theta }
  where 
  
    
      
        g
      
    
    {\displaystyle g}
   is the gravitational acceleration.
The kinetic energy is given by:

  
    
      
        T
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        m
        
          v
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}
  where 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is the velocity of the mass. To relate 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   to the other variables, the velocity is written as a combination of a movement along and perpendicular to the spring:

  
    
      
        T
        =
        
          
            1
            2
          
        
        m
        (
        
          
            
              
                x
                ˙
              
            
          
          
            2
          
        
        +
        (
        
          l
          
            0
          
        
        +
        x
        
          )
          
            2
          
        
        
          
            
              
                θ
                ˙
              
            
          
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}m({\dot {x}}^{2}+(l_{0}+x)^{2}{\dot {\theta }}^{2})}
  So the Lagrangian becomes:

  
    
      
        L
        =
        T
        −
