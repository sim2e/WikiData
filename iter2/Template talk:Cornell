Renamed Risley Theatre to the "re" spelling.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.57.70.230 (talk) 21:36, 5 October 2008 (UTC) 

I changed it back to the American English spelling, as Cornell is in America.    — Jeff G. (talk|contribs) 21:42, 5 October 2008 (UTC)I've added Risley Theater to the Student Life section. Ben 03:06, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
I have changed the font sizes to this template beacuse it was too big. At lower resolutions it occupied half the screen. I also aligned text to the left. This is personal choice. Joelito 14:24, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

I'm not sure what that edit meant.  What was inappropriate about the font applied to the template? JDoorjam     Talk 08:51, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

It is inappropriate to specify fonts for article content unless there is some kind of technical reason to do so. As far as I can tell, specifying Palatino is just for aesthetics, and there is no compelling reason to change the font of article content. And it makes the page look really ugly, with a random box of a different font. Nohat 18:09, 19 March 2006 (UTC)
Template is too big, I think. Consider streamlining? Perhaps, waste less space, or remove some items. - CrazyRussian talk/contribs/email 14:36, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

I think it is acceptable.  Compare to the template on F.A. UMich:

With the assimilation of the individual dorm stubs into West and North Campus articles, maybe the Residences section can be removed? I guess the problem would be the fact that Sage Hall would have nowhere to go, but it still feels like the template is a bit large, so this might help trim it. --Moki80 00:02, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

I'll take care of it -mercuryboardtalk ♠ 00:03, 2 June 2006 (UTC)but, moving west and north campus out of residences makes it kind of confusing--65.26.146.109 03:14, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
They're parts of campus... -mercuryboardtalk ♠ 03:27, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
i guess it works, i mean getting the template to be smaller is probably more important--Cornell010 03:46, 2 June 2006 (UTC)
I assume this is probably why Clara Dickson Hall was not part of the template... Please feel free to remove it again if this is the issue. --Notyourbroom (talk) 04:17, 17 February 2009 (UTC)
On further reflection, I reverted my own change. --Notyourbroom (talk) 04:20, 17 February 2009 (UTC)
This picture will be used on the Cornell University Template. This is due to the fact that on some pages, dealing with various Cornell University attributes, an image of the Cornell logo is not availible, in order to rectify this problem the template will retain a version of the logo along with the school name to identify the school to which the logo is associated. Also, the fact that the picture retains a combination of red and white colors further reminds any viewer that the colors of cornell are red and white, thus furthering the need for this picture.--User: Cornell010 15:06, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

Use of a copyrighted logo in this template is in direct violation of Wikipedia's fair use policy.  Specifically, "Fair use images should be used only in the article namespace... They should never be used on templates (including stub templates and navigation boxes)..."  If you disagree with this policy, bring it up at Wikipedia talk:Fair use. -SCEhardT 15:23, 22 June 2006 (UTC)
because it is a copyrighted image and therefore non-free content. It has to be used judiciously; putting it on this template automatically slaps it on forty or so pages, which is well outside the criteria for fair use. Dylan 22:17, 24 October 2007 (UTC)

I have strong reservations against the inclusion of Criticism and Theory in the Cornell template. To my eye, it appears barely notable- certainly not on the same level as the undergraduate colleges and graduate divisions- and it's apparently not even unique to Cornell. I would think it terrible if all short programs were placed into the "Academics" section along with the colleges and divisions, and I don't think we should start doing so now. —Notyourbroom (talk) 20:59, 7 March 2010 (UTC)

A really impressive article on Touchdown (mascot) existed already, so I added it under "athletics." - Kzirkel (talk) 15:48, 30 September 2017 (UTC)
