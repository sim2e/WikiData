The Leakey family is a British and Kenyan family consisting of a number of notable military figures, agricultural scientists and archaeologists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Originally a family from Somerset and Devon in south-west England in the 1500-1600s, it has spread worldwide. The Kenyan branch can be traced back to the Bazett sisters, who were early missionaries at the turn of the 19th Century; with Mary Bazett marrying Harry Leakey before setting up a Mission School at Kabete.
