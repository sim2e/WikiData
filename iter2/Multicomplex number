In mathematics, the multicomplex number systems 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{n}}
   are defined inductively as follows: Let C0 be the real number system. For every n > 0 let in be a square root of −1, that is, an imaginary unit. Then 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
        =
        {
        z
        =
        x
        +
        y
        
          i
          
            n
            +
            1
          
        
        :
        x
        ,
        y
        ∈
        
          
            C
          
          
            n
          
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{n+1}=\lbrace z=x+yi_{n+1}:x,y\in \mathbb {C} _{n}\rbrace }
  . In the multicomplex number systems one also requires that 
  
    
      
        
          i
          
            n
          
        
        
          i
          
            m
          
        
        =
        
          i
          
            m
          
        
        
          i
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle i_{n}i_{m}=i_{m}i_{n}}
   (commutativity). Then 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{1}}
   is the complex number system, 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{2}}
   is the bicomplex number system, 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            3
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{3}}
   is the tricomplex number system of Corrado Segre, and 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{n}}
   is the multicomplex number system of order n.
Each 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{n}}
   forms a Banach algebra. G. Bayley Price has written about the function theory of multicomplex systems, providing details for the bicomplex system 
  
    
      
        
          
            C
          
          
            n
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} _{n}.}
  
The multicomplex number systems are not to be confused with Clifford numbers (elements of a Clifford algebra), since Clifford's square roots of −1 anti-commute (
  
    
      
        
          i
          
            n
          
        
        
          i
          
            m
          
        
        +
        
          i
          
            m
          
        
        
          i
          
            n
          
        
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle i_{n}i_{m}+i_{m}i_{n}=0}
   when m ≠ n for Clifford). 
Because the multicomplex numbers have several square roots of –1 that commute, they also have zero divisors: 
  
    
      
        (
        
          i

            m
          
        
        )

        +
