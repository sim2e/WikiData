The Price of Anarchy (PoA)  is a concept in economics and game theory that measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents. It is a general notion that can be extended to diverse systems and notions of efficiency. For example, consider the system of transportation of a city and many agents trying to go from some initial location to a destination. Let efficiency in this case mean the average time for an agent to reach the destination. In the 'centralized' solution, a central authority can tell each agent which path to take in order to minimize the average travel time. In the 'decentralized' version, each agent chooses its own path. The Price of Anarchy measures the ratio between average travel time in the two cases.
Usually the system is modeled as a game and the efficiency is some function of the outcomes (e.g. maximum delay in a network, congestion in a transportation system, social welfare in an auction, etc.). Different concepts of equilibrium can be used to model the selfish behavior of the agents, among which the most common is the Nash equilibrium. Different flavors of Nash equilibrium lead to variations of the notion of Price of Anarchy as Pure Price of Anarchy (for deterministic equilibria), Mixed Price of Anarchy (for randomized equilibria), and Bayes–Nash Price of Anarchy (for games with incomplete information). Solution concepts other than Nash equilibrium lead to variations such as the Price of Sinking.The term Price of Anarchy was first used by Elias Koutsoupias and Christos Papadimitriou, but the idea of measuring inefficiency of equilibrium is older. The concept in its current form was designed to be the analogue of the 'approximation ratio' in an approximation algorithm or the 'competitive ratio' in an online algorithm. This is in the context of the current trend of analyzing games using algorithmic lenses (algorithmic game theory).

Mathematical definition
Consider a game  
  
    
      
        G
        =
        (
        N
        ,

        ,
        u
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle G=(N,S,u)}
  , defined by a set of players

    {\displaystyle N}
  , strategy sets

            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S_{i}}
   for each player and utilities 
  
    
      
        
          u

          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle u_{i}:S\rightarrow \mathbb {R} }
   (where 
  
    
      
        S
        =
        
          S

    {\displaystyle S=S_{1}\times ...\times S_{n}}
   also called set of outcomes). We can define a measure of efficiency of each outcome which we call welfare function 
  
    
      
        Welf
        :
        S
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Welf} :S\rightarrow \mathbb {R} }
  . Natural candidates include the sum of players utilities (utilitarian objective) 
  
    
      
        Welf
        ⁡
        (
        s
        )
        =

        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Welf} (s)=\sum _{i\in N}u_{i}(s),}
   minimum utility (fairness or egalitarian objective) 
  
    
      
        Welf
        ⁡
        (
        s
        )
        =
        
          min
          
            i
            ∈
            N
          
        
        
          u
          
            i
          
        
        (
        s
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Welf} (s)=\min _{i\in N}u_{i}(s),}
   ..., or any function that is meaningful for the particular game being analyzed and is desirable to be maximized.
We can define a subset 
  
    
      
        E
        q
        u
        i
        l
        ⊆
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle Equil\subseteq S}
   to be the set of strategies in equilibrium (for example, the set of Nash equilibria). The Price of Anarchy is then defined as the ratio between the 'worst equilibrium' and the optimal 'centralized' solution:

  
    
      
        P
        o
        A
        =
        
          
            
              
                max
                
                  s
                  ∈
                  S
                
              
              Welf
              ⁡
              (
              s
              )
            
            
              
                min
                
                  s
                  ∈
                  E
                  q
                  u
                  i
                  l
                
              
              Welf
              ⁡
              (
              s
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PoA={\frac {\max _{s\in S}\operatorname {Welf} (s)}{\min _{s\in Equil}\operatorname {Welf} (s)}}}
  
If, instead of a 'welfare' which we want to 'maximize', the function measure efficiency is a 'cost function' 
  
    
      
        Cost
        :
        S
        →
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Cost} :S\rightarrow \mathbb {R} }
   which we want to 'minimize' (e.g. delay in a network) we use (following the convention in approximation algorithms):

  
    
      
        P
        o
        A
        =
        
          
            
              
                max
                
                  s
                  ∈
                  E
                  q
                  u
                  i
                  l
                
              
              Cost
              ⁡
              (
              s
              )
            
            
              
                min
                
                  s
                  ∈
                  S
                
              
              Cost
              ⁡
              (
              s
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PoA={\frac {\max _{s\in Equil}\operatorname {Cost} (s)}{\min _{s\in S}\operatorname {Cost} (s)}}}
  
A related notion is that of the Price of Stability (PoS) which measures the ratio between the 'best equilibrium' and the optimal 'centralized' solution:

  
    
      
        P
        o
        S
        =
        
          
            
              
                max
                
                  s
                  ∈
                  S
                
              
              Welf
              ⁡
              (
              s
              )
            
            
              
                max
                
                  s
                  ∈
                  E
                  q
                  u
                  i
                  l
                
              
              Welf
              ⁡
              (
              s
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PoS={\frac {\max _{s\in S}\operatorname {Welf} (s)}{\max _{s\in Equil}\operatorname {Welf} (s)}}}
  
or in the case of cost functions:

  
    
      
        P
        o
        S
        =
        
          
            
              
                min
                
                  s

              Cost
              ⁡
              (
              s
              )
            
            
              
                min
                
                  s
                  ∈
                  S
                
              
              Cost
              ⁡
              (
              s
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle PoS={\frac {\min _{s\in Equil}\operatorname {Cost} (s)}{\min _{s\in S}\operatorname {Cost} (s)}}}
  
We know that 
  
    
      
        1
        ≤
        P
        o
        S
        ≤
        P
        o
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1\leq PoS\leq PoA}
   by the definition. It is expected that the loss in efficiency due to game-theoretical constraints is somewhere between 'PoS' and 'PoA'.
Both the PoS and the PoA have been calculated for various types of games. Some examples are presented below.

Prisoner's dilemma
Consider the 2x2 game called prisoner's dilemma, given by the following cost matrix:

and let the cost function be 
  
    
      
        C
        (
        
          s
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          s
          
            2
          
        
        )
        =
        
          u
          
            1
          
        
        (
        
          s
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          s
          
            2
          
        
        )
        +
        
          u
          
            2
          
        
        (
        
          s
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        
          s
          
            2
          
        
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle C(s_{1},s_{2})=u_{1}(s_{1},s_{2})+u_{2}(s_{1},s_{2}).}
   Now, the worst (and only) Nash Equilibrium would be when both players defect and the resulting cost is 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            e
            q
            u
            i
            l
          
        
        =
        5
        +
        5
        =
        10
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{equil}=5+5=10}
  . However, the highest social welfare occurs when both cooperate, in which case the cost is 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            m
            i
            n
          
        
        =
        1
        +
        1
        =
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{min}=1+1=2}
  . Thus the PoA of this game will be 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            e
            q
            u
            i
            l
          
        
        
          /
        
        
          C
          
            m
            i
            n
          
        
        =
        10
        
          /
        
        2
        =
        5
      
    
    {\displaystyle C_{equil}/C_{min}=10/2=5}
  .
Since the game has a unique Nash equilibrium, the PoS is equal to the PoA and it is 5 too.

Job scheduling
A more natural example is the one of job scheduling. There are 
  
    
      
        N
      
    
    {\displaystyle N}
   players and each of them has a job to run. They can choose one of 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
   machines to run the job. The Price of Anarchy compares the situation where the selection of machines is guided/directed centrally to the situation where each player chooses the machine that will make its job run fastest.
Each machine has a speed 
  
    
      
        
          s
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          s
          
            M
          
        
        >
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle s_{1},\ldots ,s_{M}>0.}
    Each job has a weight 
  
    
      
        
          w
          
            1
          
        
        ,
        …
        ,
        
          w
          
            N
          
        
        >
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle w_{1},\ldots ,w_{N}>0.}
   A player picks a machine to run his or her job on.  So, the strategies of each player are 
  
    
      
        
          A
          
            i
          
        
        =
        {
        1
        ,
        2
        ,
        …
        ,
        M
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle A_{i}=\{1,2,\ldots ,M\}.}
   Define the load on machine 
  
    
      
        j

Claim. For each job scheduling game, there exists at least one pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.
Proof. We would like to take a socially optimal action profile 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            ∗
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a^{*}}
  .  This would mean simply an action profile whose makespan is minimum.  However, this will not be enough.  There may be several such action profiles leading to a variety of different loads distributions (all having the same maximum load).  Among these, we further restrict ourselves to one that has a minimum second-largest load.  Again, this results in a set of possible load distributions, and we repeat until the 
  
    
      
        M
      
    
    {\displaystyle M}
  th-largest (i.e., smallest) load, where there can only be one distribution of loads (unique up to permutation).  This would also be called the lexicographic smallest sorted load vector.
We claim that this is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.  Reasoning by contradiction, suppose that some player 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\displaystyle i}
   could strictly improve by moving from machine 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   to machine 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  . This means that the increased load  of machine 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   after the move is still smaller than the load of machine 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   before the move. As the load of  machine 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
   must decrease as a result of the move and no other machine is affected, this means that the new configuration is guaranteed to have reduced the 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\displaystyle j}
  th-largest (or higher ranked) load in the distribution. This, however, violates the assumed lexicographic minimality of 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  . Q.E.D.

Selfish Routing
Braess's paradox
Consider a road network as shown in the adjacent diagram on which 4000 drivers wish to travel from point Start to End. The travel time in minutes on the Start–A road is the number of travelers (T) divided by 100, and on Start–B is a constant 45 minutes (likewise with the roads across from them). If the dashed road does not exist (so the traffic network has 4 roads in total), the time needed to drive Start–A–End route with 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   drivers would be 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              a
              100
            
          
        
        +
        45
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {a}{100}}+45}
  . The time needed to drive the Start–B–End route with 
  
    
      
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle b}
   drivers would be 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              b
              100
            
          
        
        +
        45
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {b}{100}}+45}
  . As there are 4000 drivers, the fact that 
  
    
      
        a
        +
        b
        =
        4000
      
    
    {\displaystyle a+b=4000}
   can be used to derive the fact that 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        b
        =
        2000
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=b=2000}
   when the system is at equilibrium. Therefore, each route takes 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              2000
              100
            
          
        
        +
        45
        =
        65
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2000}{100}}+45=65}
   minutes. If either route took less time, it would not be a Nash equilibrium: a rational driver would switch from the longer route to the shorter route.
Now suppose the dashed line A–B is a road with an extremely short travel time of approximately 0 minutes. Suppose that the road is opened and one driver tries Start–A–B–End. To his surprise he finds that his time is 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              2000
              100

        =
        40.01
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2000}{100}}+{\tfrac {2001}{100}}=40.01}
   minutes, a saving of almost 25 minutes. Soon, more of the 4000 drivers are trying this new route. The time taken rises from 40.01 and keeps climbing. When the number of drivers trying the new route reaches 2500, with 1500 still in the Start–B–End route, their time will be 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              2500

              100
            
          
        
        =
        65
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2500}{100}}+{\tfrac {4000}{100}}=65}
   minutes, which is no improvement over the original route. Meanwhile, those 1500 drivers have been slowed to 
  
    
      
        45
        +

    {\displaystyle 45+{\tfrac {4000}{100}}=85}
   minutes, a 20-minute increase. They are obliged to switch to the new route via A too, so it now takes 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              4000

   minutes. Nobody has any incentive to travel A-End or Start-B because any driver trying them will take 85 minutes. Thus, the opening of the cross route triggers an irreversible change to it by everyone, costing everyone 80 minutes instead of the original 65. If every driver were to agree not to use the A–B path, or if that route were closed, every driver would benefit by a 15-minute reduction in travel time.

Generalized routing problem
The routing problem introduced in the Braess's paradox can be generalized to many different flows traversing the same graph at the same time.
