Harvey Prize is an annual Israeli award for breakthroughs in science and technology, as well as contributions to peace in the Middle East granted by the Technion in Haifa.

History
The prize is named for industrialist and inventor Leo Harvey. Two prizes of $75,000 each are awarded each year.
Candidates are submitted by past recipients, Technion Senate members and presidents of recognized institutions of higher learning and research in Israel and abroad. Generally, recipients of the Nobel or Wolf Prizes are not eligible for the Harvey Prize, unless the accomplishments cited in the nomination represent new or different work. However, some scientists who won the Harvey Prize were later presented with the Nobel Prize, e.g. Eric Kandel, Shuji Nakamura and Katalin Karik√≥
