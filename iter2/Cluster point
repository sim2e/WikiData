In mathematics, a limit point, accumulation point, or cluster point of a set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   in a topological space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   that can be "approximated" by points of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   in the sense that every neighbourhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   with respect to the topology on 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   also contains a point of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   other than 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   itself. A limit point of a set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   does not itself have to be an element of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   
There is also a closely related concept for sequences. A cluster point or accumulation point of a sequence 
  
    
      
        (
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        
          )
          
            n
            ∈
            
              N
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x_{n})_{n\in \mathbb {N} }}
   in a topological space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   such that, for every neighbourhood 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   there are infinitely many natural numbers 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        ∈
        V
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n}\in V.}
   This definition of a cluster or accumulation point of a sequence generalizes to nets and filters. 
The similarly named notion of a limit point of a sequence (respectively, a limit point of a filter, a limit point of a net) by definition refers to a point that the sequence converges to (respectively, the filter converges to, the net converges to). Importantly, although "limit point of a set" is synonymous with "cluster/accumulation point of a set", this is not true for sequences (nor nets or filters). That is, the term "limit point of a sequence" is not synonymous with "cluster/accumulation point of a sequence". 
The limit points of a set should not be confused with adherent points (also called points of closure) for which every neighbourhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   contains some point of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  . Unlike for limit points, an adherent point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   may have a neighbourhood not containing points other than 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   itself. A limit point can be characterized as an adherent point that is not an isolated point.
Limit points of a set should also not be confused with boundary points. For example, 
  
    
      
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0}
   is a boundary point (but not a limit point) of the set 
  
    
      
        {
        0
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{0\}}
   in 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
   with standard topology. However, 
  
    
      
        0.5
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0.5}
   is a limit point (though not a boundary point) of interval 
  
    
      
        [
        0
        ,
        1
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle [0,1]}
   in 
  
    
      
        
          R
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
   with standard topology (for a less trivial example of a limit point, see the first caption).This concept profitably generalizes the notion of a limit and is the underpinning of concepts such as closed set and topological closure. Indeed, a set is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points, and the topological closure operation can be thought of as an operation that enriches a set by uniting it with its limit points.

Definition
Accumulation points of a set
Let 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   be a subset of a topological space 
  
    
      
        X
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle X.}
   
A point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a limit point or cluster point or accumulation point of the set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   if every neighbourhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   contains at least one point of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   different from 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   itself. 
It does not make a difference if we restrict the condition to open neighbourhoods only. It is often convenient to use the "open neighbourhood" form of the definition to show that a point is a limit point and to use the "general neighbourhood" form of the definition to derive facts from a known limit point. 
If 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   space (such as a metric space), then 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   is a limit point of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   if and only if every neighbourhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   contains infinitely many points of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   In fact, 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{1}}
   spaces are characterized by this property. 
If 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a Fréchet–Urysohn space (which all metric spaces and first-countable spaces are), then 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   is a limit point of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   if and only if there is a sequence of points in 
  
    
      
        S
        ∖
        {
        x
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\setminus \{x\}}
   whose limit is 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   In fact, Fréchet–Urysohn spaces are characterized by this property.
The set of limit points of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is called the derived set of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}

Special types of accumulation point of a set
If every neighbourhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   contains infinitely many points of 
  
    
      
        S
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle S,}
   then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a specific type of limit point called an ω-accumulation point of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   
If every neighbourhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   contains uncountably many points of 
  
    
      
        S
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle S,}
   then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a specific type of limit point called a condensation point of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   
If every neighbourhood 
  
    
      
        U
      
    
    {\displaystyle U}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is such that the cardinality of

  
    
      
        U
        ∩
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle U\cap S}
   equals the cardinality of 
  
    
      
        S
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle S,}
   then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a specific type of limit point called a complete accumulation point of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}

Accumulation points of sequences and nets
In a topological space 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   a point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   is said to be a cluster point or accumulation point of a sequence 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        =
        
          
            (
            
              x
              
                n
              
            
            )
          
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }=\left(x_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty }}
   if, for every neighbourhood 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   there are infinitely many 
  
    
      
        n
        ∈
        
          N
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\in \mathbb {N} }
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        ∈
        V
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n}\in V.}
   
It is equivalent to say that for every neighbourhood 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and every 
  
    
      
        
          n
          
            0
          
        
        ∈
        
          N
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle n_{0}\in \mathbb {N} ,}
   there is some 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        
          n
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq n_{0}}
   such that 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
        ∈
        V
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n}\in V.}
   
If 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a metric space or a first-countable space (or, more generally, a Fréchet–Urysohn space), then 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a cluster point of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   if and only if 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is a limit of some subsequence of 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }.}
   
The set of all cluster points of a sequence is sometimes called the limit set. 
Note that there is already the notion of limit of a sequence to mean a point 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   to which the sequence converges (that is, every neighborhood of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   contains all but finitely many elements of the sequence). That is why we do not use the term limit point of a sequence as a synonym for accumulation point of the sequence.
The concept of a net generalizes the idea of a sequence. A net is a function 
  
    
      
        f
        :
        (
        P
        ,
        ≤
        )
        →
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f:(P,\leq )\to X,}
   where 
  
    
      
        (
        P
        ,
        ≤
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (P,\leq )}
   is a directed set and 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a topological space. A point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   is said to be a cluster point or accumulation point of a net 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   if, for every neighbourhood 
  
    
      
        V
      
    
    {\displaystyle V}
   of 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   and every 
  
    
      
        
          p
          
            0
          
        
        ∈
        P
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle p_{0}\in P,}
   there is some 
  
    
      
        p
        ≥
        
          p
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle p\geq p_{0}}
   such that 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        p
        )
        ∈
        V
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(p)\in V,}
   equivalently, if 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   has a subnet which converges to 
  
    
      
        x
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle x.}
   Cluster points in nets encompass the idea of both condensation points and ω-accumulation points. Clustering and limit points are also defined for filters.

Relation between accumulation point of a sequence and accumulation point of a set
Every sequence 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙

   in 
  
    
      
        X

    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} x_{\bullet }:=\left\{x_{n}:n\in \mathbb {N} \right\}}
   can be defined in the usual way. 

If there exists an element 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   that occurs infinitely many times in the sequence, 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is an accumulation point of the sequence. But 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   need not be an accumulation point of the corresponding set

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} x_{\bullet }.}
   For example, if the sequence is the constant sequence with value 
  
    
      
        x
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle x,}
   we have

   and 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   is an isolated point of

   and not an accumulation point of

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {Im} x_{\bullet }.}
  If no element occurs infinitely many times in the sequence, for example if all the elements are distinct, any accumulation point of the sequence is an 
  
    
      
        ω

  Conversely, given a countable infinite set 
  
    
      
        A

        X

   in 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,}
   we can enumerate all the elements of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   in many ways, even with repeats, and thus associate with it many sequences 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            ∙
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\bullet }}
   that will satisfy 
  
    
      
        A
        =
        Im
        ⁡

    {\displaystyle A=\operatorname {Im} x_{\bullet }.}
  

Any

        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is an accumulation point of any of the corresponding sequences (because any neighborhood of the point will contain infinitely many elements of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and hence also infinitely many terms in any associated sequence).A point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X

   that is not an 
  
    
      
        ω
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega }
  -accumulation point of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   cannot be an accumulation point of any of the associated sequences without infinite repeats (because 
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
   has a neighborhood that contains only finitely many (possibly even none) points of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and that neighborhood can only contain finitely many terms of such sequences).

Properties
Every limit of a non-constant sequence is an accumulation point of the sequence.
And by definition, every limit point is an adherent point.
The closure 
  
    
      
        cl
        ⁡
        (
        S
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {cl} (S)}
   of a set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is a disjoint union of its limit points 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        S
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(S)}
   and isolated points 
  
    
      
        I
        (
        S
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle I(S)}
  ; that is,

A point 
  
    
      
        x
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle x\in X}
   is a limit point of 
  
    
      
        S
        ⊆
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\subseteq X}
   if and only if it is in the closure of 
  
    
      
        S
        ∖
        {
        x
        }
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S\setminus \{x\}.}
  

If we use 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        S
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(S)}
   to denote the set of limit points of 
  
    
      
        S
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle S,}
   then we have the following characterization of the closure of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  : The closure of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is equal to the union of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   and 
  
    
      
        L
        (
        S
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle L(S).}
   This fact is sometimes taken as the definition of closure.

 
A corollary of this result gives us a characterisation of closed sets: A set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is closed if and only if it contains all of its limit points.

 
No isolated point is a limit point of any set.

 
A space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is discrete if and only if no subset of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   has a limit point.

 
If a space 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   has the trivial topology and 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is a subset of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   with more than one element, then all elements of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   are limit points of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   If 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is a singleton, then every point of 
  
    
      
        X
        ∖
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\setminus S}
   is a limit point of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
