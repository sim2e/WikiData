I noticed some aren't in alphabetical order in the computer section. Seek consensus or just fix?--Canoe1967 (talk) 15:08, 2 March 2013 (UTC)

There are two major issues with this template: first off is that the "Other methods" section is incorrectly connected to the computer animation section, when of course it is everything but. Second, the "Random topics" section has utterly vanished. I have tried my best to correct these issues, but my knowledge of wiki scripting has failed me, so I am now simply going to make a record of this issues for the more skilled or ambitious. Good luck.

The shading is not quite right, but at least I managed to get it all back in there again. Hamish Paul Wilson (talk) 19:47, 2 July 2013 (UTC)

I'm removing brickfilming from the stop motion section as it seems redudnt and not a commonly accepted term. You can read more here Talk:Brickfilm#Is_this_even_a_word.3F. If reverting (readding the term), I would really appreciate if you could reply here with why it should be included---I'm open to be swayed here but I just don't see it being appropriate right now since it seems like more of a redundancy for stop-motion or brand term for a website.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by Tunafizzle (talk • contribs) 07:48, 5 June 2015 (UTC) 

Does this template have parameters? It appears not to. --Jerimee (talk) 21:54, 26 February 2022 (UTC)
