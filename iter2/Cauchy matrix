In mathematics, a Cauchy matrix, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy, is an m×n matrix with elements aij in the form

  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
            j
          
        
        =
        
          
            1
            
              
                x
                
                  i
                
              
              −
              
                y
                
                  j
                
              
            
          
        
        ;
        
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        −

    {\displaystyle a_{ij}={\frac {1}{x_{i}-y_{j}}};\quad x_{i}-y_{j}\neq 0,\quad 1\leq i\leq m,\quad 1\leq j\leq n}
  where 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y_{j}}
   are elements of a field 
  
    
      
        
          
            F
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}}
  , and 
  
    
      
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        )

   and 
  
    
      
        (
        
          y

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (y_{j})}
   are injective sequences (they contain distinct elements).
The Hilbert matrix is a special case of the Cauchy matrix, where

  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i

            j
          
        
        =
        i
        +
        j
        −
        1.
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}-y_{j}=i+j-1.\;}
  Every submatrix of a Cauchy matrix is itself a Cauchy matrix.

Cauchy determinants
The determinant of a Cauchy matrix is clearly a rational fraction in the parameters 
  
    
      
        (
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (x_{i})}
   and 
  
    
      
        (
        
          y
          
            j
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (y_{j})}
  . If the sequences were not injective, the determinant would vanish, and tends to infinity if some 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}}
   tends to 
  
    
      
        
          y
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle y_{j}}
  . A subset of its zeros and poles are thus known. The fact is that there are no more zeros and poles:
The determinant of a square Cauchy matrix A is known as a Cauchy determinant and can be given explicitly as

Generalization
A matrix C is called Cauchy-like if it is of the form
