In dynamical systems theory, the Gingerbreadman map is a chaotic two-dimensional map. It is given by the piecewise linear transformation:

  
    
      
        
          
            {
            
              
                
                  
                    x
                    
                      n
                      +
                      1
                    
                  
                  =
                  1
                  âˆ’
                  
                    y
                    
                      n
                    
                  
                  +

                    x
                    
                      n

                    y
                    
                      n
                      +
                      1
                    
                  
                  =
                  
                    x
                    
                      n
