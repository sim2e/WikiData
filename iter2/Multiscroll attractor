In the mathematics of dynamical systems, the double-scroll attractor (sometimes known as Chua's attractor) is a strange attractor observed from a physical electronic chaotic circuit (generally, Chua's circuit) with a single nonlinear resistor (see Chua's diode). The double-scroll system is often described by a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations and a 3-segment piecewise-linear equation (see Chua's equations). This makes the system easily simulated numerically and easily manifested physically due to Chua's circuits' simple design.
Using a Chua's circuit, this shape is viewed on an oscilloscope using the X, Y, and Z output signals of the circuit. This chaotic attractor is known as the double scroll because of its shape in three-dimensional space, which is similar to two saturn-like rings connected by swirling lines.
The attractor was first observed in simulations, then realized physically after Leon Chua invented the autonomous chaotic circuit which became known as Chua's circuit. The double-scroll attractor from the Chua circuit was rigorously proven to be chaotic through a number of Poincaré return maps of the attractor explicitly derived by way of compositions of the eigenvectors of the 3-dimensional state space.Numerical analysis of the double-scroll attractor has shown that its geometrical structure is made up of an infinite number of fractal-like layers. Each cross section appears to be a fractal at all scales. Recently, there has also been reported the discovery of hidden attractors within the double scroll.In 1999 Guanrong Chen (陈关荣) and Ueta proposed another double scroll chaotic attractor, called the Chen system or Chen attractor.

Plots of Chen attractor can be obtained with the Runge-Kutta method:parameters: a = 40, c = 28, b = 3
initial conditions: x(0) = -0.1, y(0) = 0.5, z(0) = -0.6
