Welcome to the WikiProject Computer science page. The goals of the project are to build a community of interest around computer science, and to provide a focal point for coordinating efforts to improve Wikipedia's computer science articles. The scope of the project includes all articles in the area of computer science, including computer programming and software engineering. 
If you would like to participate in this project, then you can optionally add your name to the list of participants. Keep in touch with project developments by adding this project to your watchlist and joining discussions on the talk page.

Looking for something to do? The current to-do list for the project consists of these tasks:

If none of those tasks sound appealing, then there are several places on Wikipedia where computer science related requests, suggestions and tasks have been collected together:

There are a few things that you should try to keep in mind while editing computer science articles.

Audience
One of the primary goals of this project is to make computer science articles accessible, so you should make an effort to explain any jargon.

Conventions
Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer science/Manual of style is a draft manual of style for CS articles.
Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Mathematics#Typesetting of mathematical formulae describes how to typeset mathematical expressions
Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Computing#Command-line examples describes how sample shell commands should be formatted

References
Try to ensure that every computer science article includes at least a few relevant references, and direct citations for anything that could be considered controversial. Wikipedia articles cannot be a substitute for a textbook (that is what Wikibooks is for), and references can give readers some idea of where they should go if they need more information  than the article can provide. Just as important, providing further reading enables other editors to verify and to extend the given information, as well as to discuss the quality of a particular source.
You can find more information on citations and references, as well as several examples for how the cited literature should look, in the style guide on citations. Wikipedia's List of publications in computer science can be a good source of references and citations for computer science articles, as can Citeseer and Google Scholar.
